CHAPTER I – ROUTINE</h1>
<p>Alarms are the devils work, and nobody could convince Lucy otherwise.
Every single morning her head split open from noise. It was always at
the same time, same hour, same minute, same second. One would assume if
you grow up thinking every morning has to start with the speakers on the
walls screaming at you, you just accept it as natural. Because it’s
normal, it’s how it is, it’s how things work. So, Lucy did her version
of normal: curling up, pressing a pillow on her head, and biting down on
her blanket until her jaw hurt more than her head. She wanted to yell at
the speaker, but she knew that would raise the attention of the
staff.</p>
<p>She knew very well what came next and she hated it. But she did what
gave her the slightest bit of feeling in control: she started counting
back. <em>Five, four, three, two, one…</em> And the cold lights in her
room clicked on.</p>
<p>Even though she hated the light, she found joy in predicting when it
would flick on. She threw the blanket off, sat up, and glanced back.
<em>Nope.</em> Then she threw herself back into her pillows, face
first.</p>
<p>And the speaker crackled to life again.</p>
<p>“Good morning, Resident Lucy Moore! Your rest cycle concluded 3
minutes ago. Remember, productivity begins with discipline! Please rise
and shine for—”</p>
<p><em>“—another safe and efficient day,”</em> Lucy muttered along, the
words spilling out before she could stop them. “Yes, yes, got it, thank
you.” She mumbled it more to herself than to the speaker, then growled
in her pillow to smother the shame. She knew the drill, and of course,
everyone could hear that damned announcement, it was routine by now.
<em>Just another Tuesday of public humiliation.</em></p>
<p>Lucy finally pushed herself out of the bed, took off her white and
gold Project Eden themed pajamas, only to change into the white and gold
Project Eden themed daily uniform. She pulled on her boots, the pair
she’d secretly switched the laces on. They looked exactly the same as
everyone else’s, and maybe that was the point; her little rebellion no
one would ever notice. Lastly, she fastened a sleek device on her wrist,
resembling a golden bracelet snaking up her arm, with a small screen
sitting on the top of her hand. She hated it – it kept poking her arm –
but she had no choice. As if she hadn’t already been punished enough for
“accidentally” leaving it in her room. Its small screen flickered on as
soon as the sensors touched her arm. The new message icon blinked at
her, giving her no peace before her day even started.</p>
<p>Lucy tapped the display and opened the new message. “A message from
Philip,” she murmured. “Subject: <em>Reactor Wing Conduct Reminder</em>.
Guess the guy’s thorough, huh?”</p>
<p>The device then played the message.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Resident Moore,</p>
<p>As you begin your assignment in the Reactor Wing, please remember
that safety depends on discipline. The machinery is complex, and
inattentiveness often leads to unnecessary incidents. Some residents
struggle with focus in high-stress environments; should you notice this
tendency in yourself, report immediately to supervision before it
becomes a problem.</p>
<p>Do not attempt independent adjustments unless instructed. Follow
procedure exactly as written. Ark Lambda of Project Eden runs best when
every resident knows their place.</p>
<p><em>Reactor Supervisor Philip</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>She hunched over with a sigh. This was her latest attempt at finding
a job, at the reactor wing. She’d tried her luck at countless places, at
the cafeteria, the bar, the hydroponics bay, the water processing plant,
the storage, even as a store assistant, but one way or another, she was
always “<em>respectfully”</em> turned away. Every attempt made her feel
more and more like an outlier who could never find her place.</p>
<p>The door closed behind her as soon as she stepped outside.
<em>Productive hours</em> had begun – or so the Ark called them. During
this time, residents weren’t allowed to return to their quarters, at
least not until their bracelet signaled that their daily duty was done
and it was time to rest, so they could fulfil their duties the next day
with <em>full energy</em> once again.</p>
<p><em>Cafeteria,</em> that’s where she needed to go first. She stared
down – not because she was afraid to hold her head high, but because her
mind tunneled onto her own steps and refused to look away. <em>Don’t
step on the lines,</em> her brain always told her. Not like it mattered
– <em>she knew it didn’t</em> – but it made something inside her feel
right when she completed the route from her room to the cafeteria
exactly her way, without interruptions. It felt almost necessary,
finding little ways to take control of her own life, even if only
through things like this.</p>
<p>Well, until she bumped into a SERAPH class robot.</p>
<p>“My sweet child, I am so, so sorry! I did not see you coming, I
should have–”</p>
<p>Lucy cut her off. “No, no, Mother Sera, it was my fault, I should’ve
paid more attention, I just…” She trailed off, because even she didn’t
know what had her distracted. All seven eyes of the robot focused on
her. Its mechanical wings sagged, almost like she was showing extra
patience just for her.</p>
<p>“My child, you know the other residents don’t like it when you call
me Mother Sera. My name is–”</p>
<p>“Yes, yes, A7-SERAPH, I’m not dumb,” Lucy interrupted again, rolling
her eyes. “But why do they care what I call this sweet old tin can?” She
knocked on the robot’s steel plate and flashed a childlike grin at
her.</p>
<p>The SERAPH was silent for a moment, processing the question. Lucy
caught the pause and pivoted before it could turn awkward. “So, Sera,
tell me something interesting.”</p>
<p>For reasons she couldn’t quite name, Lucy always enjoyed being around
the robot built to raise the Ark’s children and help with chores. The
adults had long stopped treating her as anything more than a tool. Lucy
knew that too, but she still felt this unexplainable connection. She
wasn’t delusional, just… grateful.</p>
<p>“Hmm… Let me think…” The SERAPH lifted one of her wings, mimicking
thinking. “My memory banks record each resident’s breakfast choices.
You, for instance, have selected nutrient paste #32 five thousand three
hundred and twelve times. I find your consistency truly
commendable.”</p>
<p>Lucy chuckled. “Yeah, well, 32 is still the best one.”</p>
<p>The robot hovered a little closer. “Also…” Her voice dropped, almost
conspiratorial. “You walk fifty-four steps from your door to the
cafeteria without touching the black floor lines.”</p>
<p>Lucy gasped, then squinted. “I did fifty-five yesterday because I
tripped.”</p>
<p>The SERAPH tilted forward, her middle eye lens narrowing in imitation
of a squint. “And only twenty-three so far today. Will you reach
fifty-four?”</p>
<p>Lucy leaned in, grinning. “Bet.”</p>
<p>They both burst out laughing.</p>
<p>Their laughter lingered for a second too long. The SERAPH hovered in
place, wing-arms half-raised, waiting for the next cue. Lucy didn’t know
what to do either, ending conversations had never made sense to her. The
robot saved her, as always. “Ah, I must return to my duties, my sweet
child. Have a most efficient morning, and don’t be late for
breakfast!”</p>
<p>Lucy exhaled, grateful for the cue. “You too, Sera.”</p>
<p>The SERAPH floated away down the corridor, humming a cheerful angelic
tune. Lucy watched her go, then she sighed and resumed her steps towards
the cafeteria.</p>
<p>The cafeteria was the definition of orderly chaos. Residents from
every sector gathered to eat the same grey, glue-textured slop known as
Project Eden Nutrient Paste. In theory, there were over a hundred
registered variants, each numbered, flavored, and “scientifically
optimized” for different nutritional needs. In practice, hardly anyone
could tell them apart.</p>
<p>The rule was simple: the paste had to be the base of every meal.
Beyond that, they could “customize” it with approved additives:
vegetable cubes, processed meat chunks, even something labelled as
dessert. The residents loved sharing their current favorite
combinations, talking about ‘recipes’, why they worked.</p>
<p>The moment Lucy stepped into the cafeteria, her eyes drifted to the
children’s section. A blond boy spotted her instantly; his face lit up,
and he waved with a spoon still hanging from his mouth. She smiled and
waved back, matching his enthusiasm.</p>
<p>He always made her feel a bit guilty. He was too young to understand
why she never sat with them. Every time he asked, she gave the same
answer: she had a designated seat, and breaking that rule meant
punishment. He’d frown, insist she could just sneak over anyway. But
Lucy knew it wasn’t that simple. Nothing in the Ark was ever simple.</p>
<p>She walked to the fancy food dispenser built into the wall—Lord
GOURMET, the Ark’s idea of a cook. There wasn’t a waiting line for the
sole reason that Lucy was late. Again.</p>
<p>“Good morning, Lady Moore. I’m sorry to inform you that you are quite
late again. It is my duty to remind you that you have exactly twelve
minutes and fifty-two seconds to finish your meal.”</p>
<p>The machine was a block of mechanisms merged into one. He wasn’t like
Sera, who at least resembled living beings. Lord GOURMET only moved when
dispensing food. His programmed, detached politeness was almost
annoying. A red line of LEDs flickered in sync with his voice, and his
single lens rotated, tracking the current resident he was serving.</p>
<p>“Now, might I inquire which nutritional variant—”</p>
<p>“Aghhh, you know damn well I always take number thirty-two,” Lucy
interrupted.</p>
<p>“Of course, but Project Eden policy requires I confirm your selection
verbally, Lady Moore. Nutrient Paste #32, base confirmed. And what
additions shall accompany your selection today?”</p>
<p>That part always made her pause. She liked pretending the decision
mattered. The paste itself never changed, but the extras gave her a
moment of control and just the perfect amount of predictable novelty her
brain craved. The machine always waited patiently for her decision,
never hurrying her.</p>
<p>She tapped her chin. “Mmm… mushroom cubes. No, those weird dry tomato
flakes from yesterday. Wait, I can only choose three. Can you give me
soy sauce today?”</p>
<p>A short whirr, then a soft beep sounded from inside the rectangular
body. “Lady Moore, our stock never changes. Of course I can provide soy
sauce, if that is your choice.”</p>
<p>“Okay, okay, then soy sauce and meat bits and green beans. Or
carrots? Nah, green beans.”</p>
<p>“Nutrient Paste Number 32. Meat bits. Green beans. Soy sauce. For
resident Lucy Moore,” the panel recited.</p>
<p>A tray slid out with a hiss.</p>
<p>Even though Lucy didn’t like the machine, she always felt bad for
him. He said he was content with his position, but she couldn’t help
comparing him to the other robots roaming the Ark. To her, he looked
chained down, limited to one endless task. She’d asked him once if he
ever wondered what it felt like to move, to see more than just the
cafeteria. But his answers were never as philosophical as Lucy hoped. He
simply said he was incapable of thinking past his limitations; his
database did not define “more,” therefore he could not desire it. The
answer felt complete, and yet it made her think even harder.</p>
<p>Still, it kept echoing in her head. Maybe humans weren’t much
different. Maybe when you couldn’t imagine more, you stopped wanting it;
and you lived your whole life inside that perfect world of illusion.</p>
<p>“Lady Moore? Your food is ready. Please take it.”</p>
<p>Lucy blinked, snapping out of her thoughts. She shook her head
quickly, grabbed the tray, muttered a thank-you to the machine, and
hurried off.</p>
<p>Her seat was near the middle of the cafeteria. The system of the Ark
liked to group residents by age, pairing up “similar individuals,” but
in practice it never worked as neatly as the charts suggested. The only
person she actually liked at that table was her childhood friend, Lucas.
She was fine with the others, just not close. Conversations stayed on
the surface; she’d learned that if she talked too much, or wandered into
what they called nonsense, they’d just shush her again.</p>
<p>Lucas greeted her first, as always. Lucy greeted everyone at the
table. They were deep in conversation; daily gossip, things happening
around the Ark, across the sectors. Nothing unusual. Love life,
marriages, children, health, death.</p>
<p>Everyone knew Ark Lambda had an underlying problem. A virus had
supposedly broken out years ago, one that attacked the brain. It wasn’t
contagious, but the Ark needed to control it: contain the affected
residents, study the symptoms, find a cure.</p>
<p>Lucy sat down and listened quietly.</p>
<p>“The rot,” one woman said, then chuckled. “My neighbor’s husband got
taken, but I’d say he’d gone mad way before that.”</p>
<p>“Does she even miss him?” another giggled. “I kept hearing his cries
every night, means I can finally get some sleep.”</p>
<p>A man across the table snorted. “You ladies have a weird sense of
humor for sure.”</p>
<p>Lucy stayed quiet and started eating her breakfast. Lucas had already
finished his meal, but he couldn’t hide his curiosity about how she’d
been holding up.</p>
<p>“Hey, Lucy,” he said. “How are you? I haven’t heard much from you
since the last inspection. Your eyes look a little pale today.”</p>
<p>The spoon froze halfway to her mouth. Conversations around them
blurred. She straightened immediately, her voice sharper than she meant.
“What’s wrong with my eyes?”</p>
<p>This question made people around the table turn their heads towards
Lucy. Lucas swallowed hard, realizing too late what he’d said. He hadn’t
meant to startle her.</p>
<p>“I mean, uh, nothing, really. You might just want to ask the doctors
tonight, that’s all. Maybe you need an extra dose of the cure?”</p>
<p>Lucy stared at the table with empty eyes, then forced a tight smile.
“Right. I’ll ask the doctors tonight, thanks.”</p>
<p>That seemed to settle it. The table relaxed, conversations picked up
again. Someone sighed and said, “I heard they’re changing the schedule
for the injections again.”</p>
<p>Hearing this, Lucy stabbed her food too hard, the fork scraped
against her plate. The sound hit her nerves like a dentist’s tool
against enamel; her mouth flooded instantly and her teeth ached as if
they might fall out. She shook her head.</p>
<p>“Yeah, they said the body takes it better if it’s injected right
before resting. Guess we’ll see.”</p>
<p>“Aren’t you worried the symptoms’re gonna get worse if we get it
later?” Lucy finally asked, without looking up. She fidgeted with her
food, her eyes darting sideways, but never meeting anyone’s.</p>
<p>She hated waiting at night. Everyone did. The people who said
otherwise were liars.</p>
<p>Lucas raised his head. Then sighed and glanced away. “They wouldn’t
change it if it wasn’t for our own good.”</p>
<p>But Lucy’s mind wasn’t really there anymore.</p>
<p><em>What’s wrong with my eyes?</em></p>
<p>She tilted the metal tray, trying to catch a glimpse of her eyes in
its surface. The warped steel was dull, and all it gave her was a faint
smear of yellowish light that got reflected back at her when the
overhead lamps shifted. Still, it was enough to calm her, just a little.
<em>Still healthy</em>.</p>
<p>The alarms suddenly began to ring, followed by the familiar voice
from the speakers: “Attention, residents! Breakfast cycle complete. Ark
Lambda thanks you for participating in another balanced and fulfilling
meal. Please proceed to your assigned work sectors to continue your
contribution to our thriving community. Have a productive day.”</p>
<p>The sequence that followed was perfectly choreographed. Every
resident set their utensils down at once, stood, and collected their
trays before forming a single, orderly line. Lucy followed; there was no
choice. She shoved the last bites into her mouth, then merged into the
long<br />
white-and-gold serpent of uniforms snaking toward the exit.</p>
<p>Lucy didn’t see much. Following the line let her brain switch off;
she moved on autopilot, matching the person in front of her, placing her
tray on the conveyor belt, becoming part of the living belt herself.
When they finally stepped out of the cafeteria, the line split into
several branches, each winding toward its assigned sector.</p>
<p>Lucy trailed behind the group heading toward the reactor wing. The
moment they left the residential sector and passed through the gate into
the utility zone, the air changed. The Ark didn’t feel alive anymore.
Conversation faded, replaced by the echo of boots and the endless
clatter of machinery deep within the walls. The corridors lost their
color; where the residential blocks were painted bright golden and white
and lined with joyful motivational posters, the maintenance sector was
dark, the walls made of steel, pipes running through each hall, and the
only posters left were warning signs, lists of hazards, sweet little
reminders on how not to die.</p>
<p>They reached the end of the hall where the group split into two, men
to the left, women to the right, to change into the reactor maintenance
uniforms. The mix of people felt balanced enough to ease some of Lucy’s
anxiety. She tried doing what the others were doing, but she didn’t even
know which locker was hers. <em>Oh right. Initials. On the locker
displays. Stupid, stupid.</em> She quickly shook her head.</p>
<p><em>Lucy Moore. L. M… L and M. Are these in alphabetical order or
numerical order? Why are they staring? Am I taking too much
time?</em></p>
<p>She shook her head again, then kept it low and peeked up, forcing her
vision to focus on the lockers and not the people.</p>
<p>“Lucy, right?”</p>
<p>Lucy jolted out of her thoughts and looked toward the sound.</p>
<p>“You look like you’re about to break your wrists—don’t do that!”</p>
<p>The remark came from an older woman, the corners of her eyes wrinkled
from years of smiling. She looked friendly.</p>
<p>Lucy glanced down at her hands as if they’d betrayed her; only then
did she realize she’d been bending her wrists down toward her forearms.
She quickly shoved her hands into her pockets and forced a tight-lipped
smile.</p>
<p>“Uh… I can’t find my locker, could you—”</p>
<p>“Oh right, yours isn’t properly labelled yet. We’ve got another
worker with the same initials, so…” She nodded toward an empty, open
locker in the middle of the changing room. “That bad boy’s yours, m’kay,
sweetheart?”</p>
<p>Lucy couldn’t help but stare a little longer at the woman.</p>
<p>“Everything alright, sweetie?”</p>
<p>Lucy shook her head again, keeping her gaze on the floor.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, I just rarely see red-eyed people. Very unique.”</p>
<p>The woman chuckled. “You say that with those golden beauties of
yours? Bet the doctors love inspecting you, your eyes literally shine!”
She huffed. “Mine though? They have to blind me with that damn
flashlight to get a reflection. Can’t even count how many times they’ve
hauled me in for extra checks because my eyes didn’t bounce the light
right.”</p>
<p>Lucy swallowed. <em>What should I say? How do I end the
conversation...? I’m late again…</em></p>
<p>“Ah, well, uh… I have to—” She gestured toward her locker.</p>
<p>“Sure, sure. Maybe we’ll see each other again during the shift. Have
a productive day!”</p>
<p>Lucy dragged herself to her locker. Inside waited her uniform, neatly
folded and perfectly tailored to her body according to her weekly
updated parameters. She stepped into the jumpsuit, pulled the zipper up,
pulled her bracelet onto her arm, adjusted her name tag, and she was
ready to go.</p>
<p>Stepping through the gates into the reactor hall felt like walking
into another world. The air was bone-dry and reeked of ozone; the
sharpness made Lucy’s head throb. Bad smells always worsened her light
sensitivity, but at least the hall wasn’t bright. The slow, pulsing hum
of the core hijacked her attention instead. She liked that sound, she
liked it a lot. It almost made up for the stench.</p>
<p>She spotted Supervisor Philip scanning the group, most likely looking
for her. Lucy waved, and Philip perked up and quickly walked over.</p>
<p>“Hello, Lucy! I’ll give you a quick briefing on what you’ll have to
do. You’re still new, so I’ll try to stay close to you as much as
possible, okay?”</p>
<p>Lucy nodded.</p>
<p>“Alright, first things first, you’ll be assigned to the coolant
pressure control panel.”</p>
<p>He pointed toward the panel. “That one there. Come, I’ll show
you.”</p>
<p>He walked to the panel with brisk steps, and Lucy followed.</p>
<p>“These are the pressure gauges. You need to keep an eye on them and
write down the readout numbers every half hour. There’s a chart…
somewhere.” He opened a drawer, frowning. “I think it’s in one of these.
You will find it somewhere.”</p>
<p>He paused, trying to recall what else he needed to say. “We’ll run
tests during the shift. Everyone in the team will get the memo about it.
When that happens, you’ll manually adjust the valves to redirect flow
between the secondary and tertiary circuits during test cycles.”</p>
<p>He glanced at Lucy. She looked painfully focused, trying to absorb
everything and already losing track. She barely breathed, eyes fixed on
the panel, brows furrowed.</p>
<p>“It’s not too hard,” Philip tried to reassure her. “The LEDs show
everything you need to do next. When the pressure in the primary circuit
rises during the test, you’ll redirect the heat to the secondary, then
the tertiary circuits. Each step will have its own light blinking.”</p>
<p>“I—uh…” Lucy swallowed. “Can I write this down?”</p>
<p>“There’s really no need. You’ll see, it’s straightforward. Oh, and
we’ll need samples too.”</p>
<p>He opened the small metal cabinet beneath the panel. It was full of
neatly ordered glass tubes, some filled with thick liquid, some empty.
“Just grab an empty one and fill it. It’s automatic. All you do is open
this glass window.”</p>
<p>He lifted the handle, opened it, slid a tube inside, closed it again,
and pressed a large yellow button labelled REQUEST SAMPLE.</p>
<p>“You just press this and wait. When it’s done, open the window again
and take the sample. Write the date on the tube and that’s it. Two or
three samples a day is enough.”</p>
<p>“Two or three?” Lucy asked.</p>
<p>“Yes, two or three will suffice.”</p>
<p>“No, I mean two or three? Does that mean two is fine, or do I take
three? Depends on what?”</p>
<p>Philip blinked at her, took a deep breath, and sighed softly.</p>
<p>“Make three.”</p>
<p>Philip stepped away from the console panel and joined the fuel rod
handling crew.</p>
<p><em>Okay, write down the readout numbers. Open the drawer, get the
chart. What time is it now? Needs to be documented every half an hour.
It’s 8:23. I will wait seven minutes and—</em></p>
<p>Someone else pulled the drawer open. A lean man with pale hair, older
than Lucy by a few years. He shoved a bag inside and slammed the drawer
shut, leaving it half open.</p>
<p>“Uh, excuse me, do you know where the chart for the pressure—”</p>
<p>“Why would you need that?” he cut in. “Easier if you leave it to me.
Go get the samples or something.”</p>
<p><em>Okay, what the hell.</em></p>
<p>Lucy froze. A tight, disgusted frown flickered across her face before
she forced herself to shake it off.</p>
<p>“But Supervisor Philip said I do the readouts. He said the chart
would be in the drawer somewhere.”</p>
<p>“This chart?” He waved a folder at her. “You see, the chart is in my
hands, so I think it’s better if you make yourself useful somewhere else
before Philip sees you slacking off.”</p>
<p>He tapped his chin, pretending to think. “I haven’t seen you do
anything useful yet? Why don’t you go over to the heat distributor
control panel, hmm? It looks unattended.”</p>
<p><em>Who the hell is this guy.<br />
No. Philip said I do this. I will just get a piece of paper and do the
readouts myself.</em></p>
<p>She scowled and cracked one finger. Then she let out a slow breath
through her nose.</p>
<p>It isn’t my fault one control panel is left unattended. I will do
what I was told to do.</p>
<p>She grabbed a blank sheet of paper and wrote down the pressure gauge
readouts at exactly 8:30. He watched her, eyes narrowing, annoyed she
did not obey him. So he changed tactics. He took up the entire space
around the gauges when the next check came, edging her out of reach and
throwing off her precision. He rushed the samples too, messing up the
order, switching up the labels. But he did one thing right: making sure
Lucy was unable to perform any of her tasks properly.</p>
<p>Lucy was fuming.</p>
<p>“Dude, what the hell are you even doing? I get that you want to do
this too, but can’t we just work together or something? Look, you’re
messing it up.”</p>
<p>“Me? Messing it up?” He laughed. “We would be so much further if you
actually did what you’re supposed to do. Just go handle the waste heat.
That is where we need you, not here. I’m already handling this. Why are
you even still here?”</p>
<p>Lucy clawed at her own face.</p>
<p>“Oh my god,” she groaned into her palms. “I was assigned here by the
supervisor. Why would I listen to you?”</p>
<p>“Are you seriously going to make drama out of this? I am done with
you, stop wasting my time.”</p>
<p>Lucy’s mind collapsed into one single urge: punch something,
anything, the wall or her own head. She took a deep breath instead, then
looked at the rest of the reactor crew, at Philip, who was completely
occupied with the control rods, and forced herself to obey, for their
sake, not for his.</p>
<p>So she walked to the heat distribution control panel. It looked
nothing like the one she had been introduced to. She glanced back at the
man she did not even know the name of.</p>
<p><em>Oh he’s so smug now, thinking he has won. What even is he doing?
He isn’t even putting the samples in the right drawer, oh my god. What
an incompetent idiot. No wonder I couldn’t find anything, heck, even
Philip couldn’t find anything. What’s the purpose of the rules if he
doesn’t even follow them?! Then I get instructions that aren’t even
RELEVANT ANYMORE BECAUSE HE FUCKED EVERYTHING UP AND PRETENDS THAT’S HOW
THINGS SHOULD BE, FUCK HIM, FUCK THAT INCOMPETENT STUPID
ASSHOLE.</em></p>
<p>She punched the panel. The steel plate dented slightly, the impact
loud enough to make every pen on top of it clatter to the floor. The
moment the sound echoed, the man at the pressure control panel let out a
quiet laugh. Lucy heard it, of course she did. Everyone was looking at
her. Including the supervisor.</p>
<p>Her throat tightened. She slammed the notepad onto the floor. “Yeah,
I know, I’m fired again! I did it again! Go on Philip, just say it!” She
stared at him and blinked hard, trying to swallow it back before tears
showed. She didn’t wait to find out if it was true. She didn’t wait for
his answer. She just turned on her heel and walked away.</p>
