II – ECHO</h1>
<p>Lucy stomped to the changing room, wrenched herself out of her
uniform, and shoved it back into the locker. Her mind was a mess; an
endless loop of wanting to destroy anything within reach, then shaking
her head hard to snap herself out of it. She wanted to cry, but she
couldn’t without being seen. She shook her head one last time, forced a
sharp exhale through her nose, and walked away from the main reactor
section.</p>
<p>The decontamination chamber hissed around her, but nothing was louder
than her own brain. <em>What was that for? What did you achieve? Was it
worth handing victory to that asshole? You are a liability.</em></p>
<p>The door finally opened, and she left the sector. The halls were
quiet. Everyone was busy, everyone was at their place being useful. Lucy
was preparing herself for yet another absolutely necessary talk with the
Custodians about her “continued lack of usefulness”.</p>
<p>She was lost in her thoughts until hearing her own name snapped her
out of it.</p>
<p>“Lucy, Lucy, Lucy! I missed you!”</p>
<p>A small body crashed into her, then hugged her. The same blond little
boy who had wanted to sit with her at breakfast. Despite everything,
Lucy smiled and ruffled his hair.</p>
<p>“Daniel, what are you even doing here? Isn’t it playtime at the
nursery?”</p>
<p>He nodded quickly, panting from running too fast, yet still having
way too much energy for his own good.</p>
<p>“Yes, but the nurses never pay attention,” he gasped, then rushed to
blurt out the next sentence. “I sneaked out and now I’m on an
adventure!”</p>
<p>Lucy chuckled. “You are a menace, you know that?”</p>
<p>Daniel looked up at her fully and stared for a bit. The gears were
visibly turning in his little head.</p>
<p>“Lucy, why are you sad?”</p>
<p>Her smile faded slightly. She didn’t want to burden a child with her
own issues, how she couldn’t make herself useful, how everyone kept
passing her to another sector, to be someone else’s problem. Yet she
couldn’t lie.</p>
<p>“Well, uh…” She looked away, trying to gather her thoughts to put it
in a way he could understand. “Let’s say I made a mistake again, and now
more people think I’m… clumsy.”</p>
<p>“But making mistakes is normal, Lucy! I make mistakes all the time
too! I just try again. Mother Sera said it’s okay, I can just keep
trying!”</p>
<p>Lucy pulled her lips into a tight-lipped smile. <em>I wish it were
this simple. Just keep trying. But it was exhausting not seeing
progress; only the certainty slowly creeping in that trying was
pointless, that nothing ever worked out anyway. Not with this.</em></p>
<p>“I’m trying,” she sighed. “But sometimes mean people don’t want me to
try. They want me to fail, they want me gone.”</p>
<p>Daniel was looking at her with sparkling eyes, trying to take in her
words even if he barely understood them.</p>
<p>“I got a bit angry at this mean person and I, uh…” she glanced away
with a forced, sheepish, guilty smile. “I hit the control panel.”</p>
<p>“What’s a control panel?”</p>
<p>She chuckled. “It’s like a board with buttons and switches.”</p>
<p>Daniel gasped.</p>
<p>“And you broke it and made things explode and everyone was running
and screaming and—”</p>
<p>“NO, no I didn’t break anything!” Daniel’s dramatic imagination made
her burst out laughing. “It’s just that people don’t like it when
someone gets angry like this. Like when you get scolded for throwing
tantrums. It’s the same, but the adult version.”</p>
<p>“But sometimes I get told I’m having tantrums even when I’m right,
like when Tom stole my toy robo-penguin and Mother Lisa said I probably
lost it somewhere. Then Tom got to keep my toy even though I was
crying.”</p>
<p>Lucy crouched down to his level and put her hands on his
shoulders.</p>
<p>“Exactly. And then you feel left alone, as if everyone was against
you. Even though you were just saying the truth.”</p>
<p>Daniel shifted on his legs, looked down, and fidgeted with his hands,
as if he were preparing to say something big.</p>
<p>“Lucy?”</p>
<p>“Hmm?”</p>
<p>“Will you play with me today?”</p>
<p>Lucy squinted at him. Then she imitated a low, evil laugh.</p>
<p>“You said you were on an adventure, yeah?” She leaned closer, and
whispered behind her hand. “They say there’s a monster with yellow eyes
and red hair lurking somewhere, looking for a boy named Daniel. I think
you should run.”</p>
<p>Daniel stepped back, looked at her yellow eyes, then her red hair,
then her devilish grin, and gasped. Then he clumsily turned around,
almost tripping over himself, and ran off while giggling.</p>
<p>Lucy gave him a head start, roared, and bolted after him. Daniel’s
giggles and squeals echoed through the halls.</p>
<p>They were loud. Too loud. Loud enough to draw unwanted attention,
mainly from those Lucy tried hardest to avoid. The Custodians. Faceless
watchers of the Ark, enforcing the rules, making sure everyone behaved
as intended and knew their place.</p>
<p>Lucy took the corner sharply, pounced, and caught the little boy.</p>
<p>“Hah, gotcha!” Lucy growled.</p>
<p>But Daniel wasn’t laughing. He was staring at the two shadows looming
at the end of the hall. The joy faded from Lucy’s expression too.</p>
<p>The Custodians stood at the end of the hall, observing for a moment
before starting to walk toward them.</p>
<p>“Oh, not again…” Lucy murmured, her mind already racing through every
possible outcome she knew.</p>
<p>The Custodians stopped a few steps away.</p>
<p>“Your assumption was correct.”</p>
<p>“Resident Moore has deviated from her assigned sector.”</p>
<p>“Again.”</p>
<p>The one on the right looked at the other Custodian.</p>
<p>“I fail to see justification for unscheduled interaction with a
juvenile.”</p>
<p>The other one nodded, then turned their head, focusing on Lucy as if
noticing her for the first time. “You are Resident Moore.”</p>
<p>Lucy dipped her head. “Yes.”</p>
<p>“I was under the impression,” the Custodian went on calmly, “that
Resident Moore was assigned to reactor maintenance.”</p>
<p>They glanced at the other. “Was she not?”</p>
<p>“She was,” the first Custodian replied. “Until she voluntarily left
her station.”</p>
<p>Lucy felt Daniel shift beside her.</p>
<p>“Productivity logs show no further output after two hours and
thirty-eight minutes.”</p>
<p>The second Custodian’s gaze settled fully on Lucy now. Assessing.
Weighing.</p>
<p>“Why,” they asked, “were you not where Eden placed you?”</p>
<p>Before Lucy could open her mouth, Daniel stepped forward.</p>
<p>“She left because people were mean to her!”</p>
<p>Lucy’s arm tightened around him, but she couldn’t speak up.</p>
<p>Both Custodians looked down at Daniel.</p>
<p>For a moment, Lucy almost hoped they would ignore him.</p>
<p>They didn’t.</p>
<p>“That is an incorrect assessment,” the first Custodian said gently.
“Unkindness is not an offense.”</p>
<p>The second Custodian inclined their head. “Resident Moore’s response
was, once again, disproportionate. She demonstrates a persistent
difficulty regulating her emotional state.”</p>
<p>Daniel frowned, confusion knitting his face. “But she didn’t—”</p>
<p>“Child,” the Custodian interrupted, tone softening in a way that made
Lucy’s stomach drop, “you are not equipped to judge the design.”</p>
<p>They crouched slightly, bringing themselves closer to his eye level
without ever truly lowering themselves.</p>
<p>“Correction is not cruelty,” they said. “It is mercy.”</p>
<p>Daniel’s hands curled into Lucy’s sleeve.</p>
<p>“And you, child,” the other Custodian added, “are not where you
belong.”</p>
<p>Lucy felt it then, sharp and cold. The turn.</p>
<p>“You were scheduled for the Nurture Wing,” they said to Daniel. “Your
presence here is a deviation.”</p>
<p>“I just wanted to—” he started.</p>
<p>Lucy spoke before he could finish.</p>
<p>“I took him.”</p>
<p>Both Custodians looked up at her.</p>
<p>“I’m the one who took him out of the nursery,” Lucy said quickly. “I
shouldn’t have. He didn’t sneak away. It was me. If there’s punishment,
it should be mine.”</p>
<p>Daniel stared at her. “Lucy, that’s not—”</p>
<p>“Enough.”</p>
<p>The word wasn’t loud or commanding. It simply didn’t need to be.</p>
<p>The hall went silent.</p>
<p>The Custodians straightened, their attention no longer split.</p>
<p>“Lying,” one of them said calmly, “is also noted.”</p>
<p>Lucy flinched as the blood seemed to drain from her limbs, the world
tilting.</p>
<p>“Your instinct to deflect blame,” the other continued, “is consistent
with prior behaviour.”</p>
<p>They turned slightly toward Daniel again.</p>
<p>“You will be returned to the Nurture Wing,” the Custodian said. “Play
privileges will be suspended for the remainder of the cycle.”</p>
<p>Daniel’s eyes filled with tears. “I’m sorry,” he whispered, not even
sure who he was apologizing to.</p>
<p>Lucy’s chest tightened.</p>
<p>She reached for him.</p>
<p>A Custodian stepped between them without touching either of them.</p>
<p>“Resident Moore,” they said. “You are seen.”</p>
<p>Lucy’s blood went cold.</p>
<p>“Eden is patient,” the Custodian went on, voice smooth, reverent.
“But its grace is finite.”</p>
<p>The other nodded. “You continue to disappoint the purpose you were
given.”</p>
<p>They gestured down the hall, away from Daniel.</p>
<p>“You will come with us,” they said. “There are matters to
discuss.”</p>
<p>Lucy looked down at Daniel one last time.</p>
<p>His hands were clenched at his sides now, his lips curled downward,
torn between anger, sadness and fear.</p>
<p>“I’ll be back,” she said quietly.</p>
<p>She didn’t know if she was lying.</p>
<p>The Custodians didn’t give her time to say more.</p>
<p>They turned, and Lucy followed them. Sounds around her blurred. The
echoes of their boots had already faded, yet somehow still drowned out
everything else. The light cut in her head, but she was too tired to
care.</p>
<p>She didn’t know how long she had been sitting on the edge of her bed.
She hunched forward and buried her face in her hands. Her head ached,
her mouth dry. But her biggest problem wasn’t her body protesting, but
her memory failing her.</p>
<p>She remembered the Custodians surrounding her, taking turns speaking.
Scolding her, correcting her. But the last coherent words she remembered
were unstable, volatile, unfit. After that, the memory shattered.</p>
<p>She didn’t remember the conclusion. Didn’t remember what her
punishment was. And somehow, that was worse than any punishment could
have been.</p>
<p>She hated herself for not remembering. The very people who mattered
most in the Ark had spoken to her, judged her, and she could barely
account for it. How was she supposed to explain that parts of it were
simply… gone?</p>
<p>She looked at the clock on the wall. Almost half past four.</p>
<p><em>How did the day end so quickly?<br />
I don’t even remember falling asleep.<br />
I don’t remember coming back here.</em></p>
<p>She struck her forehead with the heel of her hand.</p>
<p><em>I hate when this happens. Come on!</em></p>
<p>She closed her eyes and massaged the space between her eyebrows
instead. The harder she tried to reconstruct the moment, the more her
thoughts slipped away from her grasp.</p>
<p>A knock on the door snapped her out of it.<br />
She shook her head once, hard, then stood and opened the door.</p>
<p>It was Lucas.</p>
<p>“Hey. I just wanted to check on you,” he said. “You didn’t even look
at me when I greeted you earlier, so I figured—”</p>
<p>Lucy frowned, and tilted her head with confusion.</p>
<p>“You saw me before?” She huffed a breath. “I don’t remember shit. I’m
sorry.”</p>
<p>Lucas blinked. “Yeah. You looked pretty gloomy. I thought I’d try to
cheer you up, but you just walked straight to your room and slammed the
door.”</p>
<p>Lucy stared at him for a moment.</p>
<p>“Curious,” she muttered. “No Custodians around me?”</p>
<p>“Nah. You were alone.” He gave a small chuckle, then cleared his
throat. “Did they take you again?”</p>
<p>She didn’t laugh.</p>
<p>The absurdity of it happening so often should have been funny.
Instead, it just hurt. She was the recurring problem. The familiar case.
The punchline of the joke.</p>
<p>“Yes,” she said quietly. “Because I made a scene for no reason. I was
volatile. I let my emotions dictate my actions.”</p>
<p>Lucas bumped his fist lightly against her shoulder. “No reason?
Knowing you, you probably had a damn good one.”</p>
<p>Lucy scowled.</p>
<p>“You don’t get it.” Her grip tightened on the door handle. She
huffed. “I don’t care how many times they take me for playing with a
CHILD. But even when I’m trying to be useful, some asshole will do
anything to get on my nerves.”</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p><em>There’s no reason to explain this to him.<br />
I snapped at the reactor. I left before I was even punished. I fucked
up. Hard.<br />
I don’t need another person seeing me as a self-justified
clown.</em></p>
<p>“Forget it,” she muttered. “We’ll see which sector tries to tolerate
me next.”</p>
<p>“Actually,” Lucas said, reaching into his pocket. He pulled out a
packaged piece of chocolate. The dessert they got once a week. “I wanted
to give this to you. They say chocolate makes people happier.”</p>
<p>Lucy raised her eyebrows. “They already gave these out?”<br />
She looked away, shaking her head, forcing out a small, tired laugh. “I
guess they forgot about me.”</p>
<p>Lucas went quiet for a moment. The gesture was supposed to be kind.
It looked like it had backfired instead. He shifted, then tried to
recover.</p>
<p>“That’s why you can have mine,” he said quickly. “You like chocolate
more than I do anyway.”</p>
<p>Lucy looked at him, then at the chocolate bar. She sighed, a real
smile finally tugging at her lips, and took it.</p>
<p>“Thanks,” she said softly. “Really.”</p>
<p>She barely got the word out before a splitting pain tore through her
head. Her chest went heavy, and breathing felt like grinding her
lungs.</p>
<p>Lucy sucked in a breath through her nose.</p>
<p><em>No, not now…</em></p>
<p>Her fingers curled around the chocolate bar a little too tightly. Her
hand shook, just barely. She hoped Lucas wouldn’t notice.</p>
<p>“You okay?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” she replied too fast. She blinked hard, trying to focus her
vision. Her fingers started going numb. “Just tired.”</p>
<p>Lucas tilted his head, studying her. Mostly her eyes. His brow
furrowed.</p>
<p>“Next injection’s still an hour away,” he said, glancing down the
hall. “Should I call one of the Physicians?”</p>
<p>“No. I said I’m fine.” She stumbled back toward her bed. “Just turn
off the light and get out.”</p>
<p>“No way I’m leaving you like this. Besides, I told you this morning
your eyes looked dim—”</p>
<p>“Oh great,” she snapped. “Now you’re gonna lecture me about how you
told me so?”</p>
<p>“What? No, I just—” He cut himself off. “Never mind. I’m getting a
Physician. I’ll be right back.”</p>
<p>He was gone, running down the hall.</p>
<p>She curled up on the bed, hiding under her pillow because Lucas
hadn’t even turned the light off.</p>
<p><em>There’s no way they’re coming sooner just for me. Why did they
even have to change the schedule, FUCK IT HURTS.</em></p>
<p>She bit into her pillow, her jaw cracking from the force. She was
shivering now, teeth chattering from the chills. Her ears started
ringing too.</p>
<p><em>Just the usual, just the usual, just wait it out, it always gets
better, BUT HOW DO I WAIT FOR AN HOUR LIKE THIS, it’s fine, it was
always fine, great, I can’t feel my hands anymore, YES, THROAT, YOU GO
NUMB TOO PLEASE.</em></p>
<p>She was sobbing into her pillow now, breath breaking into sharp
gasps.</p>
<p><em>Calm down, close your eyes, imagine numbers starting from one,
then two, then three, don’t worry about the sparkly colours, just keep
counting, four, five—</em></p>
<p><em>No. This doesn’t help. I can’t breathe.</em></p>
<p><em>Narrate breathing.<br />
Breathe in, one, two, three.<br />
Breathe out, one, two, three, four, five.<br />
Breathe in, one, two, three.<br />
Breathe out, one, two, three, four, five—</em></p>
<p>Lucas took the corner too sharply and slammed into her door.</p>
<p>“THEY SAID THEY’LL DO THE INSPECTIONS AT NORMAL TIMES, LUCY! YOU
DON’T NEED TO WAIT!”</p>
<p>Lucy growled into her pillow.</p>
<p>“You’re too loud…”</p>
<p>“Sorry. But don’t worry, you’ll get your dose soon.” He stepped
closer to her bed. “I will stay with you until they arrive, okay?”</p>
<p>Lucy hummed into her pillow. The pain seemed to fade, still
lingering, but eased enough that Lucas’s presence didn’t hurt.</p>
<p>Lucas didn’t panic about Lucy’s condition. There was no reason
to.</p>
<p>Before the nightly injections, the symptoms shifted. Sometimes they
worsened, sometimes eased, sometimes didn’t change at all. There was no
pattern to it, nothing anyone could prepare for.</p>
<p>“Lucas?”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“I hate that the cure doesn’t work.”</p>
<p>Lucas flinched at that. He hesitated, then stepped closer to her bed
and sat down beside her.</p>
<p>“Why would you say that? If it didn’t work, we wouldn’t get better
after every injection.”</p>
<p>Lucy finally turned her head, no longer speaking into her pillow.</p>
<p>“Yeah? Then why can’t we just be cured completely? Do you even
remember what it was like before the rot?” She huffed. “Is this really
gonna be our life? Worrying about who’s next?”</p>
<p>Lucas scowled and rubbed his forehead.</p>
<p>“Don’t be ungrateful, Lucy. You’re talking like nothing has changed.
Only a few angels—”</p>
<p>“Few?” Lucy cut in. “Should that reassure me? If I’m one of them, or
you, or Daniel, or anyone close to me, does that make it any
better?”</p>
<p>Lucas sighed. He knew she was scared. But fear wasn’t what kept the
residents together, hope did. And Lucy sounded like she was starting to
lose it.</p>
<p>“Those thoughts come before the injections, you will feel better
soon.” He glanced towards the door. “Just please don’t mention these to
Daniel. Or anyone.”</p>
<p>Lucy’s headache flared, she hissed, then turned her face back into
her pillow.</p>
<p>“I won’t.”</p>
