        <h2 id="origin-and-distribution">Origin and distribution</h2>
<p>Pyre hounds are post-collapse canids descended from feral domestic dog populations that persisted in heavily industrialized, chemically contaminated regions. They are now widespread across the wasteland and are among the most commonly encountered medium-sized scavengers near human infrastructure.</p>
<p>They are not a distinct species in any formal sense. Their defining traits are neurological and behavioral rather than anatomical, resulting from prolonged exposure to toxic environments rather than directed evolutionary specialization.</p>
<p>Adult individuals typically weigh between 18 and 30 kilograms. Body proportions resemble mixed-breed or working dogs: long-legged, narrow-chested, and built for endurance rather than power.</p>
<h2 id="external-morphology">External morphology</h2>
<p>Overall morphology remains broadly canine. Skeletal structure, dentition, and internal anatomy show no meaningful divergence from baseline domestic dogs.</p>
<p>The coat is sparse and irregular. Repeated thermal injury causes extensive follicular damage, resulting in permanent hair loss across large body regions. Where fur remains, it is coarse, brittle, and darkened by smoke residue. Burn scarring is most common on the muzzle, shoulders, flanks, and tail.</p>
<p>Exposed skin is thickened and heavily scarred. In older individuals, chronic injury leads to pronounced hyperkeratosis and deep fissuring, giving the skin a cracked, pavement-like appearance. These changes provide limited protection against minor burns but do not prevent serious injury.</p>
<p>Eyes often appear pale or clouded. While daylight vision is functional, low-light performance is markedly impaired.</p>
<h2 id="sensory-profile">Sensory profile</h2>
<p><strong>Vision</strong><br />
Pyre hounds exhibit severely reduced low-light vision. In darkness, individuals frequently show disorientation, freezing behavior, or erratic movement. In contrast, bright light sources strongly attract attention. Flames, electric lights, headlights, and similar stimuli trigger fixation responses that override other sensory input.</p>
<p><strong>Olfaction and hearing</strong><br />
Smell and hearing remain well-developed and comparable to normal domestic dogs. Scent tracking is effective during scavenging. Loud or sudden sounds near fire sources often provoke agitation rather than avoidance.</p>
<h2 id="neurology-and-behavior">Neurology and behavior</h2>
<p>The defining feature of pyre hounds is a reversal of normal mammalian fire-avoidance behavior.</p>
<p>In most mammals, fire triggers acute stress responses and immediate withdrawal. In pyre hounds, exposure to fire and intense light activates reward pathways associated with relief and emotional regulation. This is not a loss of pain perception. Burns remain painful, and tissue damage accumulates normally. However, the reward signal is sufficiently strong to override pain-based behavioral deterrence.</p>
<p>Common behaviors include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Active approach toward open flames</p></li>
<li><p>Repeated entry into burn zones despite injury</p></li>
<li><p>Carrying objects toward fire to test flammability</p></li>
<li><p>Visible distress or agitation when fire or light is inaccessible</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These behaviors reflect compulsive stimulus-seeking rather than aggression or curiosity.</p>
<h2 id="fire-interaction">Fire interaction</h2>
<p>Near fire sources, pyre hounds frequently engage in object-carrying behavior. Individuals retrieve sticks, fabric, debris, or scrap and bring them toward flames, apparently testing whether ignition occurs. Objects that fail to burn are often discarded with visible frustration, including pacing, lowered posture, and head shaking.</p>
<p>During active fire exposure, pyre hounds enter a state of heightened activity characterized by bounding, circling, vocalization, and chaotic movement. This state appears to correspond to peak neurological reward.</p>
<p>In small fires, this activity may inadvertently extinguish flames through trampling or fuel dispersal. In larger fires, the same behavior frequently results in severe burns or death. High mortality does not suppress the behavior in surviving individuals.</p>
<h2 id="foraging-and-diet">Foraging and diet</h2>
<p>Pyre hounds are scavengers, not effective predators.</p>
<p>Hunting efficiency is low due to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Impaired night vision</p></li>
<li><p>High distractibility</p></li>
<li><p>Poor impulse control</p></li>
<li><p>Erratic movement during overstimulation</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Primary food sources include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Human refuse</p></li>
<li><p>Carrion</p></li>
<li><p>Small opportunistic prey</p></li>
<li><p>Direct provisioning near settlements</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Fire provides indirect foraging benefits. Fires flush animals into open areas, generate fresh carcasses, and expose food caches. This creates a dual reinforcement loop: fire provides both neurological reward and increased access to food.</p>
<h2 id="social-organization">Social organization</h2>
<p>Pyre hounds form loose packs, typically consisting of three to eight individuals. Pack cohesion is unstable and driven by shared attraction to environmental stimuli such as light sources, fires, and human activity rather than stable hierarchies.</p>
<p>Communication relies primarily on body posture and spatial positioning. Vocalizations are uncommon. Barking is rare; most sounds consist of sharp yelps during acute pain or overstimulation.</p>
<p>Packs commonly congregate near:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Human settlements</p></li>
<li><p>Industrial ruins</p></li>
<li><p>Electrical infrastructure</p></li>
<li><p>Burn pits</p></li>
<li><p>Active or smoldering fires</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="reproduction-and-spread">Reproduction and spread</h2>
<p>Reproductive biology remains consistent with domestic dogs. Gestation length, litter size, and development follow baseline patterns.</p>
<p>High reproductive output, short generation time, and tolerance for human proximity have enabled rapid population expansion. Pyre hounds are now among the most common canids in contaminated post-collapse environments.</p>
<h2 id="human-interaction">Human interaction</h2>
<p>Pyre hounds are generally not aggressive toward humans. During daylight, individuals often appear calm, submissive, or affiliative. At night or near artificial light, behavior becomes erratic and hazardous due to compulsive fire-seeking rather than hostility.</p>
<p>Attempts at domestication are rare and difficult. Successful management requires strict environmental control, including isolation from light sources and sensory deprivation measures such as eye covering. Most settlements tolerate pyre hounds during daylight hours and actively drive them away at night.</p>
<p>Primary risks include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Fire-starting behavior near fuel or flammable structures</p></li>
<li><p>Disruption of controlled burns</p></li>
<li><p>Creation of secondary ignition sources through object transport</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Lethal control is common in high-risk areas, though population recovery is rapid.</p>
<h2 id="ecological-role">Ecological role</h2>
<p>Pyre hounds do not dominate ecosystems through predation. Their primary ecological impact lies in fire propagation. By carrying combustible materials, entering burn zones, and clustering around ignition sources, they increase fire frequency and spread in human-adjacent environments.</p>
<p>This creates feedback loops: fires attract pyre hounds, whose behavior sustains or expands fires, which in turn attract additional individuals. In regions with dry fuel loads, this can significantly alter local fire regimes.</p>
<p>Pyre hounds are not apex predators or keystone species in a traditional sense.</p>
<p>They are behavioral amplifiers for an abiotic process.</p>
