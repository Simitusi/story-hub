        <h2 id="origin-and-persistence">Origin and persistence</h2>
<p>Mercy beasts are rare post-collapse cervids descended from elk populations that survived in heavily contaminated regions. At a distance, they are easily mistaken for normal elk. Close observation reveals extensive neurological, sensory, and metabolic failure.</p>
<p>Their continued existence is not the result of successful adaptation. It is the outcome of two factors: extreme toxicity and learned ecological avoidance. They persist because nothing can safely interact with them.</p>
<h2 id="external-morphology">External morphology</h2>
<p>Overall body structure remains consistent with elk: tall shoulder height, slender limbs, elongated neck, and prominent antlers. Body mass is comparable, though individuals frequently appear underconditioned due to inefficient foraging and chronic injury.</p>
<p>The head is distinctly abnormal. Eyes are enlarged, malformed, and opaque. Visual function is severely compromised or absent. Antlers retain normal external architecture but show extensive internal vascularization and biochemical alteration.</p>
<p>Both eyes and antlers emit faint bioluminescence. The glow is diffuse, cold-toned, and visible only in near-total darkness, typically within 50–100 meters. The animal shows no behavioral response to the light.</p>
<p>Scarring and untreated wounds are common across the body, especially on the flanks and limbs, consistent with impaired threat recognition.</p>
<h2 id="bioluminescence">Bioluminescence</h2>
<p>The bioluminescence is not functional.</p>
<p>It results from metabolic leakage in damaged ocular and antler tissues. Disrupted protein folding and abnormal cellular energy cycling produce low-level light emission as a by-product. Intensity fluctuates with metabolic state, brightening slightly when energy is available and dimming during starvation or exhaustion. This creates a slow, irregular pulse.</p>
<p>The glow imposes a continuous energetic cost and provides no survival advantage.</p>
<h2 id="sensory-function">Sensory function</h2>
<p><strong>Vision</strong><br />
Severely degraded. Most individuals are functionally blind. Spatial awareness is poor, and obstacle avoidance is unreliable.</p>
<p><strong>Olfaction and hearing</strong><br />
Both remain intact and dominate sensory processing. Mercy beasts orient primarily through scent gradients and auditory cues.</p>
<h2 id="neurology-and-behavior">Neurology and behavior</h2>
<p>Mercy beasts exhibit profound neurological impairment.</p>
<p>Neural systems responsible for threat detection, panic response, and coordinated escape are underdeveloped or damaged. Normal flight responses are absent or weak.</p>
<p>When approached by predators or humans, mercy beasts frequently fail to flee. This behavior reflects failure of danger recognition rather than calmness or resignation.</p>
<p>Movement is slow and poorly coordinated. Behavioral complexity is minimal.</p>
<h2 id="following-behavior">Following behavior</h2>
<p>Mercy beasts are often observed trailing injured humans or animals at a distance. This behavior is passive.</p>
<p>With vision compromised, mercy beasts rely on strong, stable scent sources for orientation. Injured organisms emit concentrated blood and stress-related odors that form persistent scent plumes. Mercy beasts drift toward these signals as navigational anchors.</p>
<p>They do not deliberately close distance. When the scent disperses or stops moving, the mercy beast halts or wanders. When movement resumes, the signal is reacquired.</p>
<p>The behavior appears intentional only because it is consistent.</p>
<h2 id="toxicity">Toxicity</h2>
<p>Mercy beast blood and tissues contain potent neurotoxic compounds.</p>
<p>Entry into the bloodstream causes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Immediate loss of fine motor control at the exposure site</p></li>
<li><p>Progressive, ascending paralysis</p></li>
<li><p>Respiratory muscle failure within minutes to under an hour, depending on dose</p></li>
<li><p>Preserved consciousness until late-stage failure</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There is no recovery. No immunity develops. Any significant exposure is functionally lethal.</p>
<p>Toxins remain active for several hours after death, with highest concentrations in blood, organs, ocular tissue, and central nervous system structures.</p>
<h2 id="predation-dynamics">Predation dynamics</h2>
<p>Adult mercy beasts experience negligible direct predation.</p>
<p>Predators that attack them collapse and die following contact with blood or tissue. Avoidance behavior spreads through observation rather than survival; packs abandon affected individuals and do not repeat the interaction.</p>
<p>Juveniles are occasionally killed by inexperienced predators. These events reinforce avoidance across local predator populations.</p>
<h2 id="predator-exploitation">Predator exploitation</h2>
<p>Predators do not hunt mercy beasts. They use them.</p>
<p>A glowing mercy beast emitting injury markers indicates the presence of other vulnerable organisms nearby. Predators circle at distance, searching for the secondary prey the mercy beast is tracking.</p>
<p>The mercy beast itself is ignored. It functions as a reference point rather than a target.</p>
<h2 id="diet-and-condition">Diet and condition</h2>
<p>Mercy beasts feed on conventional vegetation and mineral-rich plant matter where available. Feeding efficiency is low due to sensory and motor impairment.</p>
<p>Chronic malnutrition is common. Many individuals exhibit muscle wasting and poor body condition despite adequate forage availability.</p>
<h2 id="human-interaction">Human interaction</h2>
<p>Mercy beasts pose no direct threat but are extremely dangerous to approach.</p>
<p>Contact with blood or tissue results in permanent paralysis and death. Injured or dying individuals cannot be safely assisted, relocated, or euthanized at close range.</p>
<p>Hunting is possible only through ranged methods and requires strict protocols. Accidental exposure during processing is a frequent cause of hunter fatalities.</p>
<h2 id="economic-use">Economic use</h2>
<p><strong>Meat</strong><br />
Raw tissue is lethally toxic. Through extended acidic brining, repeated boiling with water changes, and prolonged high-temperature cooking, toxins can be degraded. The process is labor-intensive and wasteful. Properly prepared meat is safe but rare and expensive.</p>
<p><strong>Antlers</strong><br />
Bioluminescent antlers retain glow for approximately 24–48 hours post-mortem if processed correctly.</p>
<p>Preservation requires rapid removal, immediate chemical fixation, cool storage, and secondary stabilization within 24 hours. Failure results in permanent loss of luminescence. Non-glowing antlers remain valuable but command reduced prices.</p>
<p>Specialists operating near known territories handle preservation in exchange for significant profit shares. Solo hunters operating far from processing facilities rarely retain luminescence.</p>
<p><strong>Other products</strong><br />
Toxins are extracted for use as paralytic agents or poisons when diluted. Eyes are harvested for folk practices despite lacking verified efficacy.</p>
<h2 id="ecological-significance">Ecological significance</h2>
<p>Mercy beasts occupy no dominant ecological niche. Population density is extremely low.</p>
<p>Their primary ecological effects are indirect:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Predator aggregation</p></li>
<li><p>Creation of avoidance zones</p></li>
<li><p>Behavioral modification of surrounding fauna and humans</p></li>
</ul>
<p>They persist not through success, but through exclusion.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Mercy beasts are profoundly damaged animals stabilized by toxicity.</p>
<p>Blind, metabolically inefficient, and behaviorally impaired, they survive because contact with them is fatal. Their glow is cellular failure. Their passivity is neurological damage. Their following behavior is navigational drift.</p>
<p>They do not cause death.</p>
<p>They make intervention impossible.</p>
