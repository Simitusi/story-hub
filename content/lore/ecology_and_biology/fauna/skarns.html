        <h2 id="origin-and-distribution">Origin and Distribution</h2>
<p>Skarns are post-collapse mustelid hybrids that emerged in human-dense, contaminated environments where small fox populations overlapped heavily with stoats and related weasels. They are not a stable species in the classical sense. Instead, they exist as a persistent hybrid swarm, continuously reshaped by interbreeding and relentless selection for survival in ruins, scrap zones, and settlements.</p>
<p>They are widespread wherever humans leave food, materials, and structural cover behind, and conspicuously absent from deep wilderness. Their success is inseparable from human presence.</p>
<p>Adult skarns are only slightly larger than stoats, typically weighing between 1.5 and 3 kilograms. This marginal size increase is deceptive. They remain small enough to be dismissed, yet large enough to inflict serious damage.</p>
<h2 id="morphology">Morphology</h2>
<p>Despite their fox-like silhouette at a distance, skarns are mustelids in every functional sense.</p>
<p>The body is elongated and hyper-flexible, with extreme spinal mobility and a low center of gravity. Limbs are short, powerful, and set wide, built for stability and leverage rather than speed. The torso is densely muscled, optimized for twisting, clamping, and sustained exertion rather than sprinting. When a skarn moves, it moves like a weasel: flowing, elastic, and unsettlingly precise in confined spaces.</p>
<p>Fox influence is superficial. The skull carries a fox-like outline, with a slightly shortened snout, and the tail is long and bushy, used primarily for balance and communication. Everything else, from posture to movement to temperament, is unmistakably mustelid.</p>
<h2 id="head-and-dentition">Head and Dentition</h2>
<p>The skarn’s skull reads fox-like only in profile. Functionally, it is a mustelid weapon.</p>
<p>Dentition is specialized for cervical killing. The upper canines are elongated, laterally compressed, and subtly recurved, shaped to slide between vertebrae rather than crush bone. Killing does not rely on peak bite force. Instead, the skarn clamps down and refuses to let go, using sustained pressure and full-body torsion to amplify damage.</p>
<p>This is scaled-up stoat behavior. A skarn does not overpower prey through speed or mass. It exploits anatomy and persistence. Animals three to four times its own weight can be killed through precise placement and relentless grip. Against humans, this same strategy results in torn tendons, arterial damage, and facial trauma rather than fatal predation.</p>
<h2 id="integument-and-limbs">Integument and Limbs</h2>
<p>Fur distribution reflects the skarn’s hybrid origin.</p>
<p>The torso is covered in short, dense, abrasion-resistant fur typical of mustelids. The tail carries softer, longer fur with fox-like texture, functioning as a balance aid and visual signal. The limbs, however, are largely furless, with thickened, calloused skin that resists cuts, abrasion, and contamination.</p>
<p>This exposed limb skin acts like natural work gloves. It reduces snagging in wire and scrap, allows repeated contact with contaminated surfaces, and dries quickly after foraging. The feet are compact and padded, equipped with semi-retractile claws that provide silent movement and exceptional grip on cables, fabric, and uneven surfaces. Skarns can manipulate objects with surprising dexterity for their size.</p>
<h2 id="locomotion-and-endurance">Locomotion and Endurance</h2>
<p>Skarns are not fast animals. They do not need to be.</p>
<p>Movement is characterized by a bounding mustelid gait, excellent climbing ability, and extreme flexibility in tight spaces. Burst speed rarely exceeds 25 to 30 kilometers per hour, but this is irrelevant. Their strength lies in endurance.</p>
<p>A skarn can remain active for hours, repeatedly probing, retreating, re-engaging, and escalating without visible fatigue. Humans tire first. This stamina, combined with persistence, makes them disproportionately disruptive despite their small size.</p>
<h2 id="sensory-profile">Sensory Profile</h2>
<p>Olfaction is exceptionally developed and tuned specifically to human-associated cues. Skarns detect food residues, synthetic fabrics, oils, lubricants, propellants, and metal oxidation with equal ease. Unattended gear can be located from dozens of meters away.</p>
<p>Hearing is acutely sensitive to high-frequency mechanical sounds. Zippers, buckles, loose ammunition, velcro, and fabric tension shifts are all immediately noticeable. Often, skarns detect humans long before humans are aware of them.</p>
<p>Vision is adequate in daylight and strong in low light, with excellent motion sensitivity. Fine detail matters less than movement.</p>
<h2 id="vocalization">Vocalization</h2>
<p>Skarns do not vocalize like foxes.</p>
<p>Their sounds are purely mustelid: high-pitched squeaks, rapid chittering during excitement or aggression, and sharp squeals when threatened or injured. These noises are brief and close-range, more unsettling than loud. Silence is far more common, and far more dangerous.</p>
<h2 id="diet-and-foraging">Diet and Foraging</h2>
<p>Skarns are opportunistic scavengers with genuine predatory capability. Their diet includes carrion, small mammals, birds, eggs, poultry, small livestock, and human food waste. They are efficient feeders, caching excess food, returning to carcasses repeatedly, and consuming nearly everything organic.</p>
<p>Waste is minimal. Persistence is maximal.</p>
<h2 id="cognition-and-behavior">Cognition and Behavior</h2>
<p>Skarn intelligence is narrow, iterative, and relentless.</p>
<p>They do not plan ahead. They do not anticipate outcomes. Instead, they test reactions, observe consequences, and immediately modify behavior. Failed tactics are abandoned quickly. Successful ones are reinforced without hesitation.</p>
<p>This creates the illusion of cunning without requiring foresight. Within their limited domain of theft, evasion, and exploitation, they are frighteningly competent.</p>
<p>Skarns manipulate their environment constantly. Straps and buckles are loosened over time. Noise distractions are created. Blind spots and elevation changes are exploited. Human fatigue and frustration are treated as vulnerabilities to be mined.</p>
<p>When skarns want something, they escalate. Opportunistic theft becomes bold theft, then aggressive yanking, then retaliatory destruction. Items may be torn apart or urinated on, not out of malice, but as stress displacement and persistence combined.</p>
<h2 id="memory-and-retaliation">Memory and Retaliation</h2>
<p>Skarns remember individuals.</p>
<p>They track who chased them, who injured them, and who secures their gear properly. Responses range from targeted theft to delayed retaliation days or weeks later. Some humans are avoided permanently. Others acquire permanent grudges.</p>
<p>There is no reconciliation. Mustelids do not forgive.</p>
<h2 id="relationship-with-humans">Relationship with Humans</h2>
<p>Skarns are not man-eaters, but they are not harmless.</p>
<p>Most injuries occur during defensive encounters: cornering attempts, startled reactions, sleeping outdoors, or careless handling. Defensive mustelid aggression is fast, precise, and traumatic. Hands, wrists, ankles, knees, faces, and necks are common targets.</p>
<p>They are not trying to kill. They are trying to end the interaction immediately and decisively.</p>
<h2 id="social-organization">Social Organization</h2>
<p>Skarns form loose colonies of three to ten individuals. There is no fixed hierarchy. Dominance is temporary and object-based, determined by access to high-value stolen materials.</p>
<p>Nests are constructed from scavenged human objects: wiring, cloth, foil, casings, buttons, reflective debris. These materials serve practical functions such as insulation and audible alarms, but also act as status signals within the colony.</p>
<h2 id="impact-on-human-settlements">Impact on Human Settlements</h2>
<p>Skarns force behavioral and structural adaptation.</p>
<p>Settlements redesign storage, eliminate dangling objects, elevate supplies, and adopt constant vigilance. Outdoor sleeping becomes rare. Unattended gear becomes an invitation. Paranoia becomes routine.</p>
<p>A single colony can drain ten to fifteen percent of a small settlement’s material throughput through theft, damage, injury, and time loss.</p>
<h2 id="tolerance-and-coexistence">Tolerance and Coexistence</h2>
<p>Skarns are tolerated, not accepted.</p>
<p>They suppress rodents and vermin effectively. Extermination is difficult, temporary, and often counterproductive. Killing skarns escalates aggression in survivors, while their presence deters some larger predators.</p>
<p>Tolerance is a calculation, not a truce.</p>
<p>They cannot be domesticated. At best, humans establish negotiated boundaries and conditional coexistence. A “kept” skarn is not a pet. It is a ceasefire with a grudge-holding mustelid.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Skarns are not apex predators. They are not mythical. They do not want to kill you.</p>
<p>They want your food, your tools, your patience, and your attention.</p>
<p>They are small enough to dismiss, mustelid enough to exploit that dismissal, and persistent enough to force you to change how you live.</p>
<p>In a wasteland full of monsters, skarns are the animal that ruins your day.</p>
<p>And they will still steal your keys.</p>
