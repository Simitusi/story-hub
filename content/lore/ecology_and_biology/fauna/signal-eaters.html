        <h2 id="overview-and-distribution">Overview and distribution</h2>
<p>Signal eaters are massive post-collapse bats, among the largest flying vertebrates known to exist. They are concentrated around human electrical infrastructure: transmission corridors, substations, transformer yards, broadcast towers, industrial ruins with active power, and any site that produces persistent electromagnetic “noise.”</p>
<p>They are obligate predators. Electromagnetic energy does not replace food; it functions as performance fuel, allowing brief bursts of activity that would otherwise be impossible at their size.</p>
<p>Typical adult mass is <strong>300–400 kg</strong>, with exceptional individuals heavier. Wingspans commonly fall in the <strong>8–10 meter</strong> range. They are built for soaring and controlled dives, not sustained powered flight.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="external-morphology">External morphology</h2>
<p>On the ground, signal eaters look wrong in a way that immediately explains why they avoid being on the ground.</p>
<p>With wings folded, an adult can stand <strong>2.5–3 meters</strong> tall when upright. The body is long and narrow, with minimal fat reserves except around vital organs. The skeleton is lightweight for its size, with extensive air-filled cavities and structural reinforcement where flight forces concentrate.</p>
<p>Ground mobility is poor. They can drag themselves and climb, but they cannot travel efficiently on flat terrain and cannot take off without height. A grounded signal eater is vulnerable to anything that can reach it.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="head-and-sensory-anatomy">Head and sensory anatomy</h2>
<p>The skull is elongated and heavily buttressed, with thick sutures and ridged bone structures that appear to stabilize the head during high-intensity vocalization.</p>
<p>Ears are enormous and highly mobile. Each ear can approach the length of the skull, with complex internal folds and muscular control for directional sound discrimination. Signal eaters can rotate ears independently and rapidly, tracking multiple sound sources without turning the head.</p>
<p>The jaw is reinforced with hypertrophied muscle attachment points. Bite force is sufficient to crush bone. Teeth are built for tearing and holding rather than fine chewing.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="wing-structure">Wing structure</h2>
<p>The wings are not merely flight surfaces. They are multi-purpose organs.</p>
<p>The membrane is thick, heavily vascularized, and reinforced along major struts. It functions as:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A soaring surface</p></li>
<li><p>A heat radiator</p></li>
<li><p>A sensory surface for air pressure and sound reflection</p></li>
<li><p>A conduit network for charge distribution (see energetics)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The membrane tolerates damage poorly. Tears are common in older individuals and can become lethal if they disrupt flight stability or expose vulnerable tissue near high-voltage sites.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="energetics-meat-first-electricity-second">Energetics: meat first, electricity second</h2>
<p>Signal eaters run on meat. Full stop.</p>
<p>At their size, their baseline caloric requirements are enormous. They meet this through large prey, primarily <strong>static bison</strong>.</p>
<p>Electromagnetic harvesting is an enhancer, not a replacement. It supplies extra power for short-duration behaviors:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Take-off bursts</p></li>
<li><p>Escape climbs</p></li>
<li><p>High-speed strike dives</p></li>
<li><p>Maximum-intensity echolocation</p></li>
<li><p>Sustained high-load sensory processing during hunts</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Without regular access to electromagnetic sources, signal eaters can survive, but they become slower, more conservative, and less efficient hunters. Over time, hunting failures increase.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="the-bioelectric-organ">The bioelectric organ</h2>
<p>Signal eaters possess a large, specialized organ within the chest that functions as a biological capacitor system. It stores charge and rapidly releases it to flight muscles and sensory systems.</p>
<p>The organ is not a battery in the human sense. It does not “power” the animal continuously. It stores and releases energy in bursts, then recharges during roosting near strong electromagnetic fields.</p>
<h2 id="charging-behavior">Charging behavior</h2>
<p>Signal eaters recharge most effectively around active high-voltage infrastructure. They roost on towers, pylons, and substation superstructures where field strength and “leakage” are greatest.</p>
<p>During charging periods they:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Partially spread wings</p></li>
<li><p>Adjust posture and angle repeatedly</p></li>
<li><p>Remain mostly still for hours</p></li>
<li><p>Periodically reposition to maintain the strongest exposure</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This behavior is dangerous. Electrical faults, arc events, and equipment failures kill signal eaters regularly. Corpses found near infrastructure often show severe external burns and deep internal tissue damage consistent with high-energy exposure.</p>
<p>Signal eaters persist anyway because the energy payoff is real.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="echolocation-scaled-to-a-monstrous-size">Echolocation: scaled to a monstrous size</h2>
<p>Signal eater sonar operates across multiple bands depending on range and purpose.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Long-range low-frequency pulses</strong> map broad terrain and detect large structures. To humans these can feel like a deep pressure “thrumming” rather than a normal sound.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mid-range pulses</strong> refine navigation through dense ruins, corridors, or forested terrain.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>High-frequency clicks</strong> are used during terminal hunting phases for precise target imaging and strike timing.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Close-range output is painful and disorienting to humans. This is not a weapon, but it has consequences: headaches, nausea, panic responses, and hearing damage at close proximity, especially during repeated exposure.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="hunting-ecology">Hunting ecology</h2>
<h3 id="primary-prey-static-bison">Primary prey: static bison</h3>
<p>Static bison are the nutritional backbone of the signal eater population. Adult bison commonly exceed <strong>1000 kg</strong>, and large individuals can be significantly heavier. Herd density and predictable movement patterns make them high-value targets.</p>
<p>A single kill can supply massive caloric return and reduce hunting frequency. Signal eaters are not wasteful, but they are physically incapable of relocating a carcass. They feed on-site in large quantities over repeated sessions, often returning until the carcass is stripped.</p>
<h3 id="strike-method">Strike method</h3>
<p>Signal eaters kill with mass, height, and impact.</p>
<p>They approach by silent gliding, then commit to a controlled dive. At their weight, even a single collision can cause catastrophic trauma: fractured spine, ruptured organs, collapsed lungs. Talons and bite are used to secure and finish.</p>
<p>They prefer attacks that minimize ground struggle. A prolonged fight is dangerous when you are a flying animal that cannot afford wing damage.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="relationship-with-humans">Relationship with humans</h2>
<p>Signal eaters are not typical man-eaters. Humans are small, inefficient prey compared to bison. Most of the time, signal eaters ignore people entirely.</p>
<p>The problem is proximity.</p>
<p>A signal eater roosting near a settlement can produce severe secondary effects:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Acoustic stress:</strong> low-frequency pulses disrupt sleep and cause nausea and disorientation for people living too close.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Interference:</strong> the combination of charging behavior and high-intensity sonar correlates with broad disruption of radios and sensitive electronics in the surrounding area. In practical terms: communications become unreliable or fail.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Prosthetics and powered gear:</strong> augmented humans experience the worst outcomes. Motors, control systems, and feedback loops can jitter, lock, or cut out near active roost sites. Even if the animal isn’t targeting them, losing mobility under a giant flying predator is functionally catastrophic.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This creates a common pattern: signal eaters do not “attack” settlements, but settlements still suffer as long as the animal remains nearby.</p>
<p>Some primitive tribes still decided to tolerate, or even insist living near signal eaters, because these creatures provide passive protection against technological gadgets, a sort of EMP field. The trade-off is that the sound has to be physically endured.<br />
Partial hearing loss in the affected frequency ranges becomes normal/expected. Elders are often partially deaf. The tribe uses visual communication more heavily (sign language, gesture systems). Spoken language adapts - they use higher or lower frequency ranges for speech that don't overlap with the pinging as much.</p>
<p>Despite the health costs (hearing damage, stress, sleep disruption), the defensive advantage is so significant that it's culturally accepted.</p>
<h2 id="ecological-role">Ecological role</h2>
<p>Signal eaters are apex aerial predators and ecosystem shapers.</p>
<p>Their presence changes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Static bison migration patterns</p></li>
<li><p>The safety of technological zones</p></li>
<li><p>Where settlements can comfortably exist</p></li>
<li><p>Which routes remain viable for augmented travelers</p></li>
</ul>
<p>They are an organism that learned to treat human infrastructure like a feeding ground and a charging station. Humans built the towers. The signal eaters made them into habitat.</p>
<p>And once a place becomes good habitat, it stops belonging to people.</p>
