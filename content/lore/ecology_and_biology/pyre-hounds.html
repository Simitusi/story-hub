        <h2 id="general-description">General description</h2>
<p>Pyre hounds are widespread post-collapse canids descended from pre-collapse domestic dogs. They are medium-sized, lightly built animals, typically ranging from 18–30 kg depending on lineage, nutrition, and regional conditions. Their body proportions resemble working or mixed-breed dogs rather than wolves; long-legged, narrow-chested, and optimized for endurance rather than power.</p>
<p>Despite their unsettling behaviour, pyre hounds remain biologically recognizable as dogs. Their skeletal structure, dentition, reproductive cycles, and digestive systems show no radical divergence from baseline domestic canids. The most significant changes are neurological and behavioural, driven by long-term exposure to airborne neurochemical contamination in highly industrialized collapse zones.</p>
<h2 id="external-morphology">External morphology</h2>
<p>Pyre hounds exhibit highly variable coats. Fur is typically sparse, coarse, and uneven, with large regions of permanent hair loss caused by follicular damage. In areas where fur persists, it is often stiff, brittle, and darkened by chronic smoke exposure. Burn scarring is common, particularly along the muzzle, shoulders, flanks, and tail.</p>
<p>Exposed skin is thickened and leathery, showing signs of hyperkeratosis and extensive scar tissue. In older individuals, the skin develops deep fissures and discoloration resembling cracked asphalt. These adaptations offer limited protection against minor burns but do not confer true fire resistance.</p>
<p>Eyes are often pale, reflective, or glassy in appearance, with poor low-light sensitivity. Unlike most predatory canids, pyre hounds lack effective night vision and rely heavily on ambient light to navigate.</p>
<h2 id="sensory-profile">Sensory profile</h2>
<h3 id="vision">Vision</h3>
<p>Pyre hounds possess significantly impaired scotopic (low-light) vision. In darkness, they exhibit disorientation, freezing behaviour, or erratic movement. Bright light strongly attracts their attention, often overriding other sensory input. Artificial light sources such as lamps, torches, or vehicle headlights frequently trigger fixation responses.</p>
<h3 id="olfaction-and-hearing">Olfaction and hearing</h3>
<p>Smell and hearing remain well-developed and compensate partially for visual deficiencies. Pyre hounds use scent trails effectively during scavenging and can detect food sources from considerable distances. Auditory sensitivity is within normal canine ranges, though overstimulation may provoke agitation rather than avoidance.</p>
<h2 id="neurological-and-behavioural-adaptations">Neurological and behavioural adaptations</h2>
<p>The defining trait of pyre hounds is a profound inversion of fire-avoidance behaviour.</p>
<p>In typical mammals, fire triggers an immediate stress and avoidance response. In pyre hounds, this response has been disrupted. Fire, heat, and intense light instead activate reward pathways associated with relief and emotional regulation. This does not eliminate pain perception; burns remain painful and injurious. However, the neurological drive toward fire often overrides pain-based deterrence.</p>
<p>This manifests as:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Active approach toward open flames</p></li>
<li><p>Repeated re-entry into burning zones</p></li>
<li><p>Carrying and testing combustible objects</p></li>
<li><p>Agitation or distress when unable to reach perceived fire sources</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The behaviour closely resembles compulsive stimulus-seeking rather than aggression or curiosity.</p>
<h2 id="fire-interaction-and-object-manipulation">Fire interaction and object manipulation</h2>
<p>Pyre hounds frequently engage in object-carrying behaviour near fires. Individuals may retrieve sticks, fabric, scrap, or debris and bring it toward flames, observing whether ignition occurs. Objects that fail to burn are often discarded in frustration.</p>
<p>When exposed to open fire, pyre hounds display heightened activity: bounding, circling, vocalizing, and erratic movement. This state appears to correspond to intense neurological reward. In small fires, their movement may unintentionally extinguish flames through trampling or scattering fuel. In larger fires, the same behaviour frequently results in severe injury or death.</p>
<h2 id="diet-and-foraging-strategy">Diet and foraging strategy</h2>
<p>Pyre hounds are primarily scavengers.</p>
<p>They are poor hunters due to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Inadequate night vision</p></li>
<li><p>Low patience</p></li>
<li><p>High distractibility</p></li>
<li><p>Poor coordination under overstimulation</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Most individuals survive on:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Human food waste</p></li>
<li><p>Carrion</p></li>
<li><p>Small animals caught opportunistically</p></li>
<li><p>Handouts near settlements</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Fire-related events indirectly provide food. Fires drive prey, livestock, or humans into exposed areas, create fresh carcasses, or leave behind accessible remains. This establishes a secondary reinforcement loop: fire not only provides neurological relief, but also increases feeding opportunities.</p>
<h2 id="social-structure">Social structure</h2>
<p>Pyre hounds form loose packs, usually consisting of 3–8 individuals. Pack cohesion is unstable and driven more by shared attraction to environmental stimuli than by complex social hierarchies.</p>
<p>Communication relies heavily on body posture, spacing, and movement rather than vocalization. Barking is rare. Vocal sounds are typically limited to sharp yelps during acute stimulation or injury.</p>
<p>Packs frequently congregate near:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Settlements</p></li>
<li><p>Industrial ruins</p></li>
<li><p>Active generators</p></li>
<li><p>Burn pits</p></li>
<li><p>Ongoing fires</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="reproduction-and-spread">Reproduction and spread</h2>
<p>Reproductive biology remains largely unchanged from domestic dogs. High fertility, short generational intervals, and human-associated scavenging have allowed pyre hounds to spread rapidly across diverse regions.</p>
<p>Because they do not require specialized habitats and are sustained indirectly by human activity, pyre hounds have become one of the most common post-collapse canids. Their presence is now a routine feature of many wasteland ecosystems.</p>
<h2 id="human-interaction">Human interaction</h2>
<p>Pyre hounds are generally not aggressive toward humans. During daylight hours, individuals may appear calm, submissive, or even friendly. At night or near light sources, behaviour becomes unpredictable and disruptive.</p>
<p>Attempts at domestication are rare and difficult. While some humans have successfully stabilized individual animals through sensory deprivation techniques such as eye covering and environmental control, such practices are controversial and physically demanding.</p>
<p>In most settlements, pyre hounds are tolerated during the day and driven off at night.</p>
<h2 id="ecological-significance">Ecological significance</h2>
<p>Pyre hounds are not apex predators and do not dominate ecosystems through force. Instead, they function as destabilizing scavengers whose behaviour increases the frequency and spread of fires, particularly near human habitation.</p>
