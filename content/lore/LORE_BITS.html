<p>EDEN BITS:</p>
<p><em><strong><u>Project Eden:</u></strong></em> Pre-collapse
bureaucratic-authoritarian self-preserving, self-sustaining underground
facility network designed to ensure the future of humanity at all
costs.</p>
<p><em><strong><u>Eden’s Arks:</u></strong></em> The name of the
bunkers. Each bunker is named after the Greek alphabet.</p>
<p><em><strong><u>Rot:</u></strong></em> According to Eden propaganda,
it’s the “virus” spreading among the residents of Ark Lambda. In truth,
it covers the side effects the Ark’s experiments cause, mainly the
withdrawal symptoms of long term neurochemical exposure. Nightly
injections of various chemicals reduce the withdrawal symptoms; the
residents are conditioned to believe the “cure” (see: Protocol: PANDORA)
works.</p>
<p><em><strong><u>Protocol: PANDORA:</u></strong></em> The name of the
ongoing human experiment in Ark Lambda. The goal is to study and
understand the effects of long term neurochemical exposure,
intentionally induced addiction, and how the condition “aberration”
happens. It is perceived as a noble cause if looking at the big picture:
the goal is to prevent a deadly condition, to help humanity fight off a
problem affecting the whole outside world. But this means deliberately
pushing Ark residents into unrecoverable madness in hopes of
understanding, and preventing it.</p>
<p>The experiment also involves modifying the concentration of the
neurochemicals, hybridizing them, testing different degrees of exposure,
hoping they can find a mixture that forces the body to develop
resistance or even immunity to the aberration.</p>
<p>Currently, the experiment is stalling. The subjects developed strange
genetical mutations, most notable being the unnaturally bright,
metallic, light-reflective eye colours on the whole colour spectrum. The
cause of developing a specific eye colour is unknown, and the colour
never changes after birth. Withdrawal symptoms cause the colour of the
eye to fade, and people taken by the “rot” lose the metallic reflection
completely, meanwhile a fresh dose of neurochemicals force the irises to
“shine” stronger. All this, plus propaganda made the residents believe
that bright eyes mean they are healthy, faded eyes mean they need more
of the “cure”, because it’s a sign of declining health.</p>
<p><em><strong><u>Angels:</u></strong></em> This is what the residents
call the people taken by the “Rot” (see: Aberrants). People gone mad,
developing cannibalistic urges and abnormal physical deformities,
custodians quickly take them into quarantines for further research
before any casualties happen. The residents are told they are taken to
be put out of their misery, they don’t know about the quarantine.</p>
<p>WASTELAND BITS:</p>
<p><em><strong><u>Aberration:</u></strong></em> A condition that happens
after extensive drug dependency. Side effects are physical mutations,
skin degeneration, and modified needs, body craves human flesh.
Cannibalism alone induces another sequence of cellular degeneration
causing the persons DNA to mutate, and the dependency and the
cannibalism together force the body to depend on drugs AND human flesh.
Drugs help suppress the craving for human flesh, but it’s only a surface
level solution, because the longer time between meals, the more the
brain degenerates, and that process is not reversible.</p>
<p><em><strong><u>Aberrants</u></strong></em>: People who got consumed
by the Aberration, their mind is mostly gone, monsters lurking in
shadows, feeding on people. Aberrants are the tragic victims who
refused, or couldn’t satisfy their need for human flesh, therefore lost
their mind.</p>
<p><em><strong><u>Resurgents:</u></strong></em> Aberrants, but they keep
their condition in check through constantly consuming human flesh. They
are hated by society because being a resurgent means being a well-fed
cannibal, a successful serial killer whose life depends on killing other
people and eating them.</p>
<p><em>“Resurgents CANNOT be redeemed. That’s the tragedy of the
aberration. Do you think cannibalism that cannot be forced back is
redeemable without completely erasing the urge? That’s the tragedy of
the aberration. Combine it with a post-apocalyptic world where drugs are
more accessible than water, where people suppress struggles and pain
through drug abuse, becoming aberrant means either becoming a serial
killer or staying morally okay-ish, but means basically inevitable doom
through starvation. Imagine a starving person surviving through abusing
drugs, an otherwise sweet person, but is forced to choose between dying
or giving in to self-preservation and killing their family as a
temporary solution, but this only means that they will have to keep
killing people. Imagine that person killing their family and suddenly
they aren’t starving anymore because their family’s flesh is being
fucking preserved in the basement. They don’t need normal human food
anymore. Imagine a world that has these types of people casually living
among normal humans. These are the resurgents.”</em></p>
<p><em><br />
</em></p>
<p><em><strong><u>Collapse:</u></strong></em> The collapse of humanity
happened in multiple steps. Capitalism causing overproduction,
competition causing the invention of less and less morally plausible
products. “People had everything and couldn’t spend their money on
anything new”, there was nothing to invent anymore, society was becoming
numb, losing the will to keep going because everything felt “old”. This
inevitably forced the market to desensitize, controversy and taboos
became mainstream instead of illegal, people yearned for novelty. After
one prodigious breakthrough in the synthetic neurostimulant industry,
the demand for synthetic drugs skyrocketed. More and more former
medicine brands started specializing in neurochemicals, launching
products that aimed to enhance various human functions. Society returned
to its old vivid colours, people were once again living. Until it all
crashed down:<br />
- Synthetic drug factories dominated the cities, the residue of the
production started polluting the air, releasing hallucinogenic gases.
The production process also demanded an enormous amounts of water, toxic
waste overwhelmed nature, the water became unsafe for consumption.<br />
- Humanity tried to battle this with water production plants and huge
air and water purification systems, but not learning from the mistakes,
still prioritizing stable industry instead of the wellbeing of people,
the water was mainly transferred to factories, which, of course, looped
back to the original issues.<br />
- Climate change also became an issue, but humanity simply couldn’t
afford to care about that too, if drinkable water and clean air was
slowly disappearing from the planet.<br />
- Finally, governments realized that this can’t go on, the
mass-production of neurochemicals have to be discontinued. This
generated a worldwide outrage among civilians, violent protests, which
revealed just how dependent society became on chemicals. The production
couldn’t be stopped anymore.<br />
- The last straw of the Collapse was when people started cannibalizing
each other. First just a few affected smaller villages, then the
condition spread to big cities. Authorities tried stopping the chain of
events by quarantining people showing signs, but ended in authorities
themselves eating the quarantined people out of desperation. Fear and
desperation forced society to “eat the neighbour before they eat you”,
civilians stopped trusting their own family, mass murder depopulated
overcrowded cities, the former factories emptied out, unattended, most
production plants failed, releasing even more toxic waste and
radiation.<br />
- The air in some regions became irreversibly hallucinogenic and toxic,
forcing inhabitants to live underground with multiple layers of air
filtering, and only venture outside in protective gear. Other regions
were overwhelmed with radiation, while others got scorched to the ground
by the sun itself.</p>
<p><strong>GLOBAL COLLAPSE: ORIGINS, MECHANISMS, AND
IRREVERSIBILITY</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pre-Collapse Conditions: Novelty Death and Societal
Exhaustion</strong></p>
<p>Humanity entered the final pre-collapse era already destabilized.
Late-stage capitalism caused extreme overproduction; markets became
saturated, innovation stalled, and novelty died. People “had everything”
yet felt nothing. With no new meaningful progress to pursue, society
became numb, bored, and desensitized. Controversy, taboos, and extremes
shifted from forbidden to mainstream as people chased stimulation at any
cost. Humanity did not collapse from lack, but from surplus without
meaning.</p>
<p>This collective boredom and emotional exhaustion eroded long-term
thinking. The future stopped feeling real. Responsibility became
abstract. Individual comfort, relief, and sensation replaced collective
survival as motivators.</p>
<p><strong>The Neurochemical Breakthrough and Cultural
Dependence</strong></p>
<p>A prodigious breakthrough in synthetic neurostimulants reignited
society. Drugs were no longer fringe or medical; they became lifestyle
products. Former pharmaceutical companies pivoted into neurochemical
industries, releasing compounds marketed to enhance focus, pleasure,
productivity, emotional stability, and endurance.</p>
<p>Demand exploded across all classes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Wealthy populations abused drugs recreationally.</p></li>
<li><p>Poor populations relied on them for escape, endurance, and
survival.</p></li>
<li><p>Middle classes normalized “regulated” use.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Society regained vividness. People felt alive again. Dependency
formed before consequences were understood.</p>
<p><strong>Environmental Degradation and Resource Collapse</strong></p>
<p>Industrial neurochemical production overwhelmed planetary
systems:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Factories dominated cities.</p></li>
<li><p>Toxic byproducts polluted air and water.</p></li>
<li><p>Hallucinogenic gases entered the atmosphere.</p></li>
<li><p>Water supplies were diverted to factories over
civilians.</p></li>
<li><p>Waste overwhelmed ecosystems.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Humanity attempted technological fixes: purification plants, sealed
systems, underground infrastructure. These measures prioritized
industrial continuity over human well-being, worsening inequality and
reinforcing dependence.</p>
<p>Climate change accelerated but was deprioritized. Humanity could not
afford to care about everything at once.</p>
<p><strong>Addiction Revelation and the Point of No Return</strong></p>
<p>Governments eventually attempted to halt neurochemical production.
The response revealed the truth: civilization was already addicted.</p>
<p>Global outrage followed. Violent protests erupted. Withdrawal,
desperation, and riots exposed the scale of dependency. Production could
no longer be stopped without collapsing society overnight.</p>
<p>This marked the irreversible tipping point.</p>
<p><strong>ABERRATION: BIOLOGICAL AND SOCIAL FAILURE</strong></p>
<p><strong>Aberration as a Condition, Not a Virus</strong></p>
<p>Aberration is not contagious. It is the cumulative outcome of
prolonged drug dependency, neurochemical rewiring, and cellular
degeneration.</p>
<p>Key traits:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Severe neurological damage</p></li>
<li><p>Loss of impulse control and empathy</p></li>
<li><p>Physical mutations and skin degeneration</p></li>
<li><p>Modified hunger and reward systems</p></li>
<li><p>The brain registers human flesh as the only viable food
source</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Cannibalism is not cultural but neurological, comparable to
rabies-like delusion. Once initiated, it accelerates DNA corruption.
Drug use suppresses cravings temporarily but worsens long-term
degeneration. Damage is irreversible.</p>
<p>Stopping drug use does not reverse aberration once the threshold is
crossed.</p>
<p><strong>Aberrants and Resurgents</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Aberrants</strong>: Individuals who refuse or cannot
sustain cannibalism. Their minds collapse. They become feral, tragic
monsters driven by starvation and neurological decay.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Resurgents</strong>: Aberrants who survive by constantly
consuming human flesh. They retain cognition but at the cost of being
functional serial killers. Their condition is permanent and
irredeemable.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Resurgents represent the most horrifying outcome: survival through
normalized atrocity.</p>
<p><strong>THE COLLAPSE OF CIVILIZATION</strong></p>
<p><strong>Breakdown of Trust and Authority</strong></p>
<p>Cannibalism first appeared in isolated communities, then cities.
Authorities attempted quarantines. Those efforts failed when even
enforcement forces succumbed to starvation and desperation.</p>
<p>Fear reframed morality:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“Eat your neighbor before they eat you.”</p></li>
<li><p>Families stopped trusting each other.</p></li>
<li><p>Cities depopulated through mass murder.</p></li>
<li><p>Infrastructure collapsed unattended.</p></li>
<li><p>Factories failed catastrophically, releasing more toxins and
radiation.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Humanity fractured into:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Cannibal colonies</p></li>
<li><p>Drug-worshipping cultures</p></li>
<li><p>Resurgent towns</p></li>
<li><p>Isolated survivor enclaves</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The world became uninhabitable in many regions, forcing underground
living and sealed environments.</p>
<p><strong>COLLECTIVE MINDSET SHIFT: WHY HUMANITY COULD NOT
STOP</strong></p>
<p>The collapse was not caused by ignorance. Humanity knew the
risks.</p>
<p>The failure was psychological and structural:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Short-term relief outweighed long-term survival.</p></li>
<li><p>Individual restraint felt pointless if others didn’t
comply.</p></li>
<li><p>“One person stopping changes nothing.”</p></li>
<li><p>“We’ll die anyway.”</p></li>
<li><p>“I know my limits.”</p></li>
<li><p>“Not my problem.”</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This mirrors real-world systemic failures such as climate collapse.
Collective restraint cannot emerge voluntarily under exhaustion and
despair. Humans do not unionize against invisible, delayed consequences
without enforcement.</p>
<p>The real “virus” was the mindset: denial, exhaustion, and the belief
that accountability no longer mattered.</p>
<p><strong>PROJECT EDEN: ORIGIN AND INTENT</strong></p>
<p><strong>Birth of Eden</strong></p>
<p>Project Eden emerged after the collapse of centralized authority,
cities, and governance. Humanity lost all external control mechanisms.
Individuals relied solely on personal decisions, which consistently
prioritized short-term relief over survival.</p>
<p>Eden was not founded to conquer, dominate, or rule. It was a last
desperate attempt to restore structure in a species incapable of
self-restraint.</p>
<p>Eden’s foundational realization:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Aberration cannot be stopped by education, morality, or
individual choice.</p></li>
<li><p>It requires collective restraint.</p></li>
<li><p>Collective restraint does not occur voluntarily under
collapse.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, restraint must be imposed.</p>
<p><strong>Eden’s Moral Position</strong></p>
<p>Eden is not noble. It is not benevolent. It is desperate.</p>
<p>Its logic:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Remove choice to prevent catastrophe.</p></li>
<li><p>Enforce compliance to stabilize humanity.</p></li>
<li><p>Sacrifice small populations for potential insight.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Eden does not believe in gods. It positions itself as one because
authority must feel absolute to function.</p>
<p><strong>THE ARKS AND PROTOCOL: PANDORA</strong></p>
<p>Project Eden created underground Arks as controlled environments for
human experimentation. Each Ark is named after the Greek alphabet.</p>
<p><strong>Ark Lambda</strong> hosts Protocol: PANDORA.</p>
<p>Goals:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Study long-term neurochemical exposure.</p></li>
<li><p>Induce addiction intentionally.</p></li>
<li><p>Observe aberration onset.</p></li>
<li><p>Attempt to force genetic resistance or immunity.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Methods:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Controlled dosing</p></li>
<li><p>Hybridized compounds</p></li>
<li><p>Generational exposure</p></li>
<li><p>Genetic drift observation</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Outcome:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>No direct cure.</p></li>
<li><p>No transferable solution.</p></li>
<li><p>Only insight.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The experiment stalled. Resistance did not scale. Genetic mutations
emerged instead, including metallic, light-reflective eyes. Eye
brightness became propaganda: bright meant “healthy,” faded meant “needs
more cure.”</p>
<p>Residents believe in “Rot” as a disease. In truth, it is
withdrawal.</p>
<p><strong>THE TRAGEDY OF EDEN</strong></p>
<p>Protocol Pandora’s greatest failure is structural:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Genetic resistance cannot be injected.</p></li>
<li><p>Breeding immunity does not save existing populations.</p></li>
<li><p>Ark Lambda is a hypothesis, not a solution.</p></li>
<li><p>The project may never yield a cure.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Eden continues because admitting failure would mean acknowledging
irreversible atrocity without payoff.</p>
<p>Opening the gates is not mercy. It is abandonment. An experiment
deemed no longer containable.</p>
