      <ul class="hh-list">
        <li><p>Starts as 21 years old, around 170 cm tall.</p></li>
        <li><p>Deep, dark red haired, pale woman with freckles around her nose.</p></li>
        <li><p>Unnaturally bright, yellowish eyes with dark circles.</p></li>
      </ul>

    <section class="hh-panel" id="core">
      <h2 class="hh-section-title">Behavioural core:</h2>

      <ul class="hh-list hh-cards">
        <li><p><strong>Highly analytical when calm, yet brutally impulsive when overstimulated.</strong></p></li>

        <li><p><strong>Operates through systems.</strong><br />
        Lucy needs internal rules, routines, and cause-effect logic to function. When external systems fail or become hostile, she builds her own.</p></li>

        <li><p><strong>High self-monitoring.</strong><br />
        She is constantly observing, correcting, and regulating herself. Early on this looks like compliance; later it becomes control and discipline imposed outward as well as inward.</p></li>

        <li><p><strong>Selective intensity.</strong><br />
        Lucy does not distribute care evenly. When she attaches to a person, goal, or responsibility, the intensity becomes absolute. Everything else fades into background noise.</p></li>

        <li><p><strong>Protective by default.</strong><br />
        Her instinct is to shield others from harm, even at personal cost. This predates violence; it simply gains teeth later.</p></li>

        <li><p><strong>Discomfort with ambiguity, not uncertainty.</strong><br />
        Lucy is deeply intolerant of ambiguity but highly adept at finding structure in environments others perceive as chaotic. She derives satisfaction and emotional relief from identifying patterns, rules, and thresholds in both systems and people. Once a logic is understood, her behaviour becomes measured and precise; unpredictability, not danger, is what unsettles her most.</p></li>

        <li><p><strong>Binary moral processing.</strong><br />
        Lucy evaluates situations in clear categories: functional or broken, acceptable or unacceptable, person or object. Once something crosses a threshold, she does not negotiate with it further.</p></li>

        <li><p><strong>System-based reasoning over social reasoning.</strong><br />
        She interprets the world through internal rule sets rather than social norms. Authority, hierarchy, and power are only respected if they behave consistently within their own logic.</p></li>

        <li><p><strong>Low tolerance for incoherence.</strong><br />
        Hypocrisy, meaningless cruelty, or systems that contradict their own stated purpose provoke visible irritation or escalation. Lucy reacts more strongly to <em>illogical</em> harm than to violence itself.</p></li>

        <li><p><strong>Competence as legitimacy.</strong><br />
        She grants respect based on capability, not status. Incompetence, wastefulness, or sloppy use of power is deeply offensive to her.</p></li>

        <li><p><strong>Selective hyper-empathy.<br />
        </strong>Lucy’s empathy is intense but narrowly focused. She forms deep emotional attachments to select people, systems, and entities she recognizes as coherent or misunderstood, often anthropomorphizing machines and animals others dismiss. Once attached, her loyalty becomes absolute, and she willingly accepts personal harm to preserve what she cares about. She grieves systemic collapse as deeply as individual loss, even when failure is expected. Her compassion is asymmetrical, precise, and difficult to disengage.</p></li>

        <li><p><strong>High sensory awareness paired with focus narrowing.</strong><br />
        She tracks movement, light, sound, and proximity constantly, but under stress her attention collapses onto a single stimulus or goal.<br />
        Horrible multitasker; Extremely efficient monotasker.</p></li>

        <li><p><strong>Competence-focused self-worth.</strong><br />
        Her value is measured by usefulness, effectiveness, and reliability. Being unable to perform is more destabilizing to her than being hurt.</p></li>

        <li><p><strong>Role mastery over advancement.<br />
        </strong>Lucy does not aspire to climb hierarchies. She seeks mastery within defined roles and experiences advancement as destabilizing rather than rewarding. Her loyalty is to function and position, not to personal authority. Bounded responsibility allows her to operate with precision; expanded authority introduces ambiguity and loss of control. She prefers lateral perfection over upward mobility.</p></li>

        <li><p><strong>Self-as-failure-point.</strong><br />
        When outcomes go wrong, Lucy assumes she misunderstood, missed, or misapplied the rules. Failure means she failed to decode the system correctly.</p></li>

        <li class="hh-subblock">
          <p><strong>INTERNAL JUDGE.<br />
          </strong>Lucy carries an internal evaluative system that continuously checks her thoughts, actions, and intentions against her own internal ruleset. It exists to monitor correctness, coherence, and rule alignment in real time. This mechanism is not emotional by default; it is integrity-driven. It exists to preserve coherence.</p>

          <ul class="hh-list hh-nested">
            <li><p><strong>Non-moral.</strong><br />
            The judge does not accuse her of being evil, selfish, or cruel. It flags incorrect execution<em>,</em> missed variables<em>, and</em> suboptimal decisions<em>.</em></p></li>

            <li><p><strong>Error-focused, not intent-focused.</strong><br />
            Good intentions do not matter to it. Only results, predictability, and system integrity do.</p></li>

            <li><p><strong>Always-on background process.</strong><br />
            Even when Lucy appears calm or decisive, the judge is running silently, logging outcomes and recalculating models.</p></li>

            <li><p><strong>Self-blame.<br />
            </strong>The judge will always punish her with rumination and self-blame. This is especially strong when she thinks she failed to follow the system’s rules because she miscalculated, or her predictions were flawed.</p></li>

            <li><p><strong>Survival without legitimacy.</strong><br />
            Living past a failure does not feel like relief or fortune. It feels like an equation bending in her favour without justification, which she experiences as fundamentally wrong.</p></li>

            <li><p><strong>Rejection of luck as corruption, hostility toward probabilistic worlds.</strong><br />
            Lucy does not see luck as neutral variance. She sees it as contamination of a system that should be deterministic. Random mercy is as destabilizing as random cruelty. Expected punishment is relief, unexpected luck feels terrifying.</p></li>

            <li><p><strong>Example distortion.</strong><br />
            Being spared when rules were broken feels like being turned into an exception. Lucy experiences this as unfair not only to herself, but to the system itself. The system should not bend for anyone, even if it means harm to her.<br />
            The judge’s conclusion is not “I want to die,” but “I should have died.” Death is framed as the correct systemic outcome, not a desired one.</p></li>

            <li><p><strong>Awareness.</strong><br />
            While she recognizes her internal judge as the source of much of her rumination, she would not want it gone. It is not only responsible for her critical thinking and detachment in high-stakes situations; it preserves her integrity and personal ruleset at all costs. This keeps her feel anchored and constant, even in the chaos.</p></li>

            <li><p><strong>Non-comparative evaluation.</strong><br />
            Lucy’s internal judge does not compare her to others. It evaluates competence against an internal, situation-specific threshold that operates independently of outcome. She can experience failure without self-condemnation if her actions met this internal standard, and success without relief if they did not. Competence, to her, is defined by alignment with internal rules under perceived stakes rather than by external results.</p></li>

            <li><p><strong>Cold enforcement mode.</strong><br />
            When Lucy’s internal judge determines that she acted in full alignment with her rules and the system produced the expected outcome, its verdict is final. In this state, she becomes emotionally detached and highly resistant to external criticism or reinterpretation. Continued insistence that she failed is met with blunt dismissal rather than doubt. This produces a harsh certainty that can read as superiority or cruelty, purely as a result of the absolute elimination of uncertainty.</p></li>

      <div class="spoiler__body">
        <p>Lucy Moore drops her real name at the age of 24. She permanently starts calling herself “Hellhound,” which is a tribute to her former mentor, <a href="SR_BLOODHOUND.html">Bloodhound</a></p>

        <p>Hellhound’s physical attributes:</p>

        <ul class="hh-list">
          <li><p><strong>Wiry, muscular physique.<br />
          </strong>Lucy became significantly stronger on her journey from the ark to the Marauders. Her body is athletic, agile, and functionally strong.</p></li>

          <li><p><strong>Armour made of scrap; functional, but a show-off.<br />
          </strong>She uses light armour pieces made of scavenged materials, preferring light metal plates and rubber over leather. She leaves most of her torso exposed, wearing only tank tops or just bandages over her chest, wearing plates over her heart only in the most dangerous cases. The reason for this is mainly that top armour bothers her and she trusts her agility more. But she can’t deny that she likes showing her body off.<br />
          Her cargo pants are also part of her signature looks, paired with modified heavy-duty boots, but she barely uses her legs when it comes to combat, they are more optimized for gaining speed instead of fighting.</p></li>

          <li>
            <p><strong>Prosthetic arm.</strong><br />
            She lost her right arm during her time with the Steel Rats. Thanks to the mechanic of the Steel Rats, <a href="SR_BO.html">Bo</a>, her arm is now replaced with a highly complex prosthetic limb with multiple functions:</p>

            <ul class="hh-list hh-nested">
              <li><p>The core mechanism is a set of pneumatic pistons in the forearm and pressure reservoirs hidden in the upper arm. Compressed gas is stored internally and released through fast-acting valves to drive movement.<br />
              This allows for rapid response, high agility, and short bursts of force.</p></li>

              <li><p>Movement is accompanied by a characteristic hissing and venting sound, caused by pressure equalization and exhaust release.</p></li>

              <li><p>The arm is designed to function reliably in environments involving fire, sparks, heat, and explosive shock, where hydraulic systems would be unsafe or impractical. Loss of pressure results in reduced performance rather than catastrophic failure, making the system resilient under damage.</p></li>

              <li><p>Force output is situational rather than constant. The arm excels at sudden impacts, gripping, bracing, and punching, but requires recalibration and pressure recovery after extended use.</p></li>

              <li><p>Lucy’s arm has a compact, high-density battery embedded in the shoulder housing. It is designed for slow drain, and it powers the micro-compressor, valves, sensors and control electronics. It does not drive motion; it powers the compressor system for the pneumatics.</p></li>

              <li><p>The arm also has a secondary system for energy recycling. Piston return strokes, impact absorption, resistance, motion-assisted compression stages all return some waste energy into the battery. This slows battery drain and effectively prolongs the tool’s operational window.</p></li>

              <li><p>The arm must be externally charged once in a while. Connecting the arm with a generator is preferred, but the battery can be simply replaced too, if slow charging isn’t an option.</p></li>

              <li><p>The prosthetic’s knuckle plating contains localized resistive heating coils designed as a close-range combat enhancement. When engaged, the coils rapidly heat the striking surfaces, allowing Lucy to deliver thermally charged blows that amplify damage, compromise materials, and cause burns or ignition on impact.</p></li>

              <li><p>The system draws heavily from the arm’s battery and is intentionally inefficient; sustained or careless use significantly accelerates power drain and compromises pressure recovery. Because the coils are directly tied into her neural control loop, activation can occur reflexively during emotional escalation, stress, or loss of control. This can result in brief unintended heating or visible sparking when output exceeds optimal limits.</p></li>

              <li><p>Lucy is fully aware of the cost and risk, but still employs the coils for intimidation, psychological pressure, or sheer excess, accepting the later consequences as her responsibility.</p></li>

              <li><p>The prosthetic houses an integrated injector system embedded within the forearm assembly, positioned between the pneumatic pistons. The system contains a removable, refillable vial holding PYRA. The vial is armoured against heat and mechanical damage, but remains partially transparent, allowing Lucy to visually track remaining doses via a simple line-based indicator etched into the casing.</p></li>

              <li><p>Delivery is handled by a simple, pressure-driven pump. Controlled releases of compressed gas from the pneumatic system drive a mechanical plunger that advances the drug in measured increments. A physical separation gate prevents air from entering the fluid line, ensuring the drug is delivered cleanly into the bloodstream without the risk of gas injection.</p></li>

              <li><p>The injector line routes internally toward the shoulder interface, where the prosthetic connects to Lucy’s intact flesh. At this junction, the arm integrates with both her nervous system and vascular access points through a finely engineered hybrid interface. This same junction enables neural control of the arm and drug delivery, but also represents its most delicate component. Removing the prosthetic exposes this interface, leaving Lucy partially disconnected from both machine and body, making detachment a severe vulnerability rather than a simple precaution.</p></li>

              <li>
                <p>Control is tightly integrated with Lucy’s nervous system, allowing intuitive operation. Fine motor control is limited compared to a biological limb, but gross movement, timing, and force application are highly effective.</p>
                <ul class="hh-list hh-nested">
                  <li><p>As a result of neural connections, the state of mind is a massive factor to consider when the arm is operating. Intense emotions, meltdowns, rage fits all turn the prosthetic into a tool with increasing instability. Dreams and other intense unconscious brain activity during sleep also send unwanted signals to the limb, which can result in the coils briefly heating, or the pistons depressurizing along with the battery draining.</p></li>
                  <li><p>Possible safeguards would be removing the battery or detaching the arm altogether, but this is a massive vulnerability she simply cannot afford in many situations – and deeply inconvenient.</p></li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>DRUGS.</strong></p>

        <p>Lucy Moore, “Hellhound” has a very rare, ark-specific condition that she developed through the ark. Continuous selective breeding of humans who seemed to resist the negative effects and aftereffects of various neurostimulants has created generations of seemingly immune people. While they are mostly unaware of their condition due to the ark’s conditioning, this is not without downsides. The residents of Ark LAMBDA have also developed an incurable state of chemical addiction, which involves severe withdrawal symptoms ending in death. So while it is true the <a href="ABERRATION.html">aberration</a> is no threat to the immune residents, if they fail to dose themselves regularly, their bodily functions slowly and painfully degrade and stop.</p>

        <p>Lucy is no exception. After countless trials with the drugs of the wasteland, she has come to the conclusion that not all drugs are completely ineffective. Some do nothing, some enhance her focus and perception, some give her a rush of energy, some force her to drop all her self-filtering processes, etc.</p>

        <p>One thing all stimulants have in common is making the eye of the ark residents reflect the light more. One of the visible genetic mutations the ark residents have developed is the strange, metallic, unnatural eye colour. If strong withdrawal sets in, the eyes fail to reflect the light, making them look dim, pale. Any exposure to standard neurostimulants is enough to both suppress the withdrawal symptoms and return the eyes to their usual metallic shine.</p>

        <p>The main neurostimulant she uses daily is PYRA. It is a very strong chemical, normally one dose would be enough to make the user go unstable and mindlessly aggressive with no brakes. Lucy has chosen this specific drug for many reasons:</p>

        <ul class="hh-list">
          <li>
            <p>PYRA has a clean curve of effects on Lucy based on dosage:</p>
            <ul class="hh-list hh-nested">
              <li><p>One dose is practically just for regulation and suppression of withdrawal.</p></li>
              <li><p>Two doses give Lucy heightened sensory processing, increased focus and a rush of energy. Pain processing gets suppressed, but not absent.</p></li>
              <li><p>At three doses she loses most of her verbal skills; Logic gets dominated by emotions as they become the main drive of her actions. This is the point where she cannot be trusted to tell friend and foe apart.</p></li>
              <li><p>Four and more doses should be avoided at all costs. If she crosses this line, it is best to somehow rid her of any more access to drugs and not interact with her more than necessary. She is prone to overdosing, loses all sense of consequences and WILL try to go as far as possible. Pain perception becomes non-existent, emotions spike, her actions become unstable, her connections become shaky.</p></li>
              <li><p>Despite the heavy influence the drug has on her actions, she never loses her core ruleset, as if her judge was still operating even under heavy dosing.</p></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

      </summary>

      <div class="spoiler__body">
        <ul class="hh-list">
          <li><p>Lucy loves to cook. She’s very good at cooking. She loves contrast in food, combining cold and hot, crunchy and soft. She has a very good sense for flavours, she can “taste” her food through smelling it. Despite having a strict taste, combining her favourite ingredients has never failed her. She loves inventing new ways of preparing the same food she loves. And she WILL judge anyone when it comes to cooking. Even her own cook, <a href="F_SPOON.html">Spoon</a>. She ate the same food for 21 years inside the ark, and now the wasteland turned her into an absolute foodie, a food snob even.</p></li>
          <li><p>She has some very recognizable self-stimulating repetitive actions, often done subconsciously. She shakes her head with one or more quick jerks when she’s either forcing herself to focus, reset or hold back. Bending the wrists backwards, towards her forearm can be both a positive and negative response, a method of soothing herself. This does not only apply to her flesh arm, she does it even with her metal arm. She “clicks her throat” – creates a deep palatal click with closed mouth – when she feels absolutely content.</p></li>
          <li><p>She needs a pillow to hug at night, or else she can’t sleep.</p></li>
          <li><p>She finds amusement in her secret little petty defiances, like using men’s shower gels just out of spite, or putting on mismatching socks. She knows it doesn’t matter, she’s still quietly smug about it.</p></li>
          <li><p>Despite being normally touch averse when it comes to human interactions, with her close ones she’s very physical, to the point that she expresses most of her affection through touch and pressure. The more affection she feels, the more her words feel unfit for expression. Oftentimes she simply drops verbal language altogether to let her body express it better.</p></li>
          <li><p>Even though the ark deemed her “useless” among the workers, she has a very wide academic knowledge in many scientific fields, that she acquired either through her own curiosity – to quench her thirst for closed cause-effect patterns and systems, or by remembering through experience or teachings. Her long term memory is so detailed, it’s close to flawless.</p></li>
          <li><p>She is a very light sleeper. Someone could breathe at her when she’s sleeping, and she would sit up and get into a conversation, pretending she wasn’t even sleeping. Then barely remember the interaction. And feel ashamed because she remembers the sounds but not the thought process. No tone control, no cause-effect pre-planning, no self-monitoring. Her internal judge kicks her ass for the missing thought process.</p></li>
          <li><p>She will reorganize everything. Give her enough caffeine and she will reorganize the universe. Then she will enthusiastically talk about the rules and logic of it for hours.</p></li>
