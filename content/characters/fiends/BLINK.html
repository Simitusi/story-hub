        <p>BLINK (she/her) – Fiends’ scout, sniper, game hunter, assassin, spy, manipulator</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Only a few months younger than Hellhound (~25)</p></li>
<li><p>Around 165 cm, slim, athletic body, sneaky light build barely 55kg</p></li>
<li><p>Green-brown eyes, ash blonde long straight hair, she has a half up half down braided ponytail. She thinks it’s cute</p></li>
<li><p>She doesn’t look like a raider at all. She prefers looking sexy in her own way: black leather jacket, white shirt, green scarf, cargo pants or jeans sometimes just to show off her ass, and a pair of steel toed hardy leather boots. She still uses raider decorations like chains or scrap, but she won’t go overboard with it. She usually gets called a scavenger or even a settler, not a raider. That’s exactly why she makes a good spy. She sells the innocent act</p></li>
<li><p>She was a Marauder way before Hellhound even became a thing. She is a born Marauder, parents are Marauders too, she was just born into raider life.</p></li>
<li><p>She has a past with a mafia gang, she left them on good terms</p></li>
<li><p>Exceptionally skilled with sniper rifles and bows. She loves her Thompson rifle too. She is a very good shot, at the Fiends her job is scouting from her watchtower, disabling any threats she can from a distance. She has an .50cal anti materiel rifle too, but she only uses that when she absolutely wants to make a mess. Or a statement. Otherwise, she prefers her trusty compound bow.</p></li>
<li><p>She is a cunning manipulator who prefers talking her way out of shitty situations rather than turning to violence</p></li>
<li><p>Bar is her playground. She loves seducing drunk men, getting what she wants, then dipping</p></li>
<li><p>Surprisingly, she enjoys torture, and she has her own favourite methods, which are much more elegant than how most Fiends do the job</p></li>
<li><p>She loves sweets. She will steal your sweets. She will definitely get distracted by sweets or energy drinks even if she’s on an important mission. She is a junk food gremlin</p></li>
<li><p>She hides behind big words, confidence, manipulation, sass, but deep down she’s very insecure and hates that most Fiends don’t trust her, even though she has always been loyal</p></li>
<li><p>Some Fiends just call her “fox” but in a bad way. Nobody knows whom she will next try to manipulate for her own goals</p></li>
<li><p>Skittish as hell. She will definitely prioritize getting out alive over doing heroics. She is good at range not in brawls.</p></li>
<li><p>She wouldn’t openly admit it, but she is scared of drugged up Hellhound. Words can’t save her from drugged up Hellhound and she’s scared one day while overdosing, the Fiends Queen will turn against her own crew.</p></li>
