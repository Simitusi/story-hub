CHAPTER I – THRESHOLD</h1>
<p>The dust cloud surrounded her bike as she stopped by the gates of the
Marauders. She killed the engine and stretched, sighing in satisfaction
when her spine popped, as if two guards weren’t actively tracking her
head with heavy machine guns from the top of the massive spiked wall in
front of her.</p>
<p>“Who the fuck are you?”</p>
<p>She lazily tipped her head back and looked up. Then smirked.</p>
<p>“Wouldn’t you like to know.”</p>
<p>“Drop the tone, girl.” One of the guards gave the mounted gun a heavy
slap, as if it needed encouragement. “Be a damn shame if your stupid ass
attitude got your pretty face turned into a smoking, bloody mess.”</p>
<p>A beat.</p>
<p>“The fuck do you want here?”</p>
<p>She stretched her arms wide and laughed.</p>
<p>“Came here to meet Mama Bear herself.”</p>
<p>The guards snickered.</p>
<p>“Nyx? Lookin’ at you, ya might actually last as her personal
plaything.”</p>
<p>One of the guards elbowed the other. “Shit, ’s rare we get
volunteers.”</p>
<p>They burst out laughing again. Then the makeshift gate, resembling a
huge garage door, creaked open. But she couldn’t just walk in, that
would’ve been too easy. Another set of armed guards walked out to
surround her. She sighed, rolled her eyes and slowly raised both hands,
one flesh and one metal. One guard slammed the butt of their gun against
her shoulderblade. She grunted but shook it off.</p>
<p>“What’s your name, scav?”</p>
<p>“Hellhound.” Her reply was short, quick. Her attention was on the
other guards behind her, checking out her bike and the gear strapped to
it. She knew they would touch her stuff but it still annoyed her.</p>
<p>“Fancy name,” one sneered from behind. “Puppy forgot her teeth, huh?”
The others howled, doubled over with laughter. She huffed a laugh too.
Their amusement was contagious, even with her as the target.</p>
<p>Oh, but they didn’t like her reaction. You don’t just laugh when you
get insulted by the Marauders. The guard by her side shoved her
forward.</p>
<p>“Nice arm. Can you take it off?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“We can cut it off.”</p>
<p>She squinted up at the guard, then tilted her head.</p>
<p>“You seem very smart.”</p>
<p>They held eye contact for a few seconds before the other guard shoved
her, spitting, “Move already.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>As they walked through the gates, Hellhound had a subtle smile grow
on her face. True, they detained her, but that meant one thing: they
were taking her seriously. Judging by her past experience with raider
groups, that alone was progress.</p>
<p>The guards split into two groups. One walked Hellhound further into
the settlement. The other rolled her bike in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>Hellhound’s eyes twitched as they followed the guards making off with
her gear. The metal coils in her prosthetic popped as the heat spiked. A
spark jumped towards one of the guards.</p>
<p>“Hey, watch it,” he snapped. “The fuck are you doing?”</p>
<p>Hellhound huffed. “Oops.”</p>
<p>She yanked her arm back, straightened it, let it click into place.
The heating coils slowly cooled.</p>
<p>The guards scowled.</p>
<p>She grinned and shrugged. “Can’t help it. Has a mind of its own.”</p>
<p>As they walked further, she took in her surroundings. She’d heard a
lot about the Marauders, but seeing the town in person? That was a
different beast. Compared to them the Steel Rats felt pathetic. The
Marauders looked… functional. Structured. All of them had a certain
swagger, as if they believed inside the walls, inside their world, they
were invincible. The Steel Rats felt like survivors. The Marauders were
like a pack of predators. Or so they believed.</p>
<p>What caught Hellhound’s eye most, though, was the sheer number of
slaves lining the streets. Collared. On leashes. Locked in cages.
Presented on markets, shoved to the ground, dragged like pets, or
bunched together, tied in clusters. Sold. Traded. Shown off. Used.</p>
<p>“Hey scav, what’s with your eyes?”</p>
<p>Hellhound blinked, pulled out of her own thoughts. She glanced up at
the guard, raising an eyebrow.</p>
<p>“What’s it look like, hmm?”</p>
<p>“You must enjoy acting all mysterious, dog. Annoying as fuck.”</p>
<p>Hellhound shrugged.</p>
<p>“Didn’t come here for you, did I?” She grinned.</p>
<p>“We’ll see about that.” He snickered. “Once Nyx admits you’re just
meat. Might even end up on a leash, pup.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Another guard spoke up, curiosity finally getting the better of
him.</p>
<p>“You a raider too right?” He looked her up and down, quite impressed.
“You look like one at least.”</p>
<p>“Grew out of my old crew,” Hellhound’s tone shifted. “Figured it was
time to go for the bigger fish.”</p>
<p>“Hellhound… why does this name sound familiar…” The guard frowned.
The third guard, who was mostly silent, chimed in.</p>
<p>“It’s ‘cause of Bloodhound. Old guy hasn’t visited us for a while.”
He glanced at Hellhound. “Although, could be just a coincidence.”</p>
<p>Hearing his name again made Hellhound’s stomach drop and her smirk
fade. She couldn’t force the smile back. She shook her head once, sharp,
like she could reset her mask.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>They passed more and more guards. <em>That should mean we are nearing
the center of the hive.</em></p>
<p>Turning a corner revealed an enormous, crude building, barely
resembling its original form; a church. It was adorned with rusty
spikes, metal wires, bent steel beams, scavenged pylons; hell, even
railroad spikes, anything dangerous, really. And skulls. Skulls
everywhere. On the spikes. Around the barricades. Hung from the walls.
<em>Nyx has a very specific aesthetic she’s fond of, it seems.</em></p>
<p>But at the same time, Hellhound couldn’t help but grin at the irony.
Seeing a church, a house of “God,” in this state felt like a mocking
snicker at her past with religion. She liked the honesty of it.
<em>Deserved. Right.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The biggest guard stepped forward and shoved the door open. It took a
moment for her eyes to adjust to the darkness inside. The interior was
even more spectacular than the outside. Hanging braziers lit the hall,
their smoke curling toward the high vaulted ceiling. Cages littered the
hall, some empty, most housing a few slaves. The cages weren’t big
enough for one human. Let alone more. Stakes and spikes were driven
wherever there was room. Torn clothes and bones almost artistically hung
from the metal, skulls mounted on rusty spikes.</p>
<p>The middle of the hall was mostly left empty, leaving space for
raiders gathering in front of the very thing that dominated the whole
interior: the throne. Nyx didn’t seem to be subtle about presenting
power. It stood out immediately, built from scavenged parts that were
obviously worth more than everything else in the room combined.</p>
<p>On the throne sat Nyx herself. She lounged with her elbow propped,
chin resting in her hand, seemingly bored. She was having a frustrated
discussion with one of the raider warlords in front of her, which got
conveniently interrupted by Hellhound stepping into her line of sight.
She raised one eyebrow as her whole attention shifted to the
newcomer.</p>
<p>Hellhound felt the way the ruler of the Marauders looked her up and
down. Nyx saw her as an object, nothing more. No questions. A fancy
toy.</p>
<p><em>Expected.</em></p>
<p>“Hmm, you come bearing gifts for your Empress?” She sneered.</p>
<p>She wasn’t talking to Hellhound, no. She was looking at the guards.
Hellhound <em>was</em> the gift.</p>
<p><em>Also. Expected.</em></p>
<p>Nyx leaned forward in her throne. She wasn’t really interested until
the flickers of the braziers reflected in the newcomer’s eyes. The
Empress squinted. In the dim light, those eyes looked like they were
glowing. Golden.</p>
<p>“Bring her closer.” She gestured toward the guards around
Hellhound.</p>
<p>The guards pushed Hellhound towards the throne. She never met Nyx’s
gaze. She held her head low, only observing by tilting her head
sideways. The flame of the braziers held her attention hostage. Sparks
popping, coal embers flaring up and cooling off.</p>
<p>They stopped right in front of Nyx. The Empress rose from her throne
and stepped closer. She grabbed Hellhound’s chin with rough hands and
forced it up to meet her gaze. Hellhound’s eye twitched.</p>
<p>“Interesting.” She flicked her fingers between Hellhound’s eyes
without touching her. Hellhound flinched, groaned, but didn’t speak.</p>
<p>“So they work…” She leaned closer to inspect Hellhound’s eyes. “Are
they real?”</p>
<p>Hellhound forced a quick puff of air through her nose. “Yeah. Played
with my flamethrower until it burned my eyes, now fire got stuck in
there.” She bared her teeth.</p>
<p>Bullshit.</p>
<p>Nyx wasn’t sold. Her eye twitched. Her grip tightened on Hellhound’s
jaw. One of the guards finally spoke up.</p>
<p>“She came here by herself. We confiscated her bike–”</p>
<p>“Bike?” Nyx never broke the eye contact. “Are you some trader wannabe
or what?”</p>
<p>Hellhound rolled her eyes. Big fucking mistake. Nyx yanked her jaw
sideways so suddenly the joint popped.</p>
<p>“Got an attitude problem too?” The Empress wasn’t impressed.</p>
<p>Hellhound had a desperate urge to shake her head. She tugged at it
just a bit, then stopped herself. <em>This wasn’t good. Nyx was pissed.
She poked the bear alright. Now she had to pay attention. Can’t fuck
this up.</em></p>
<p>Hellhound looked away. <em>Submission.</em></p>
<p>Nyx’s grip loosened just enough. <em>She accepted it.</em></p>
<p>“Speak. What’s your name.”</p>
<p><em>Pause. Can’t show we were waiting for permission.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Hellhound.”</p>
<p>Nyx narrowed her eyes. She examined Hellhound’s face just a little
longer. Then let go of her jaw with a slight push.</p>
<p>“We asked what she wanted,” the guard added fast, glancing at Nyx.
“But she only said she’s here for you.”</p>
<p>“Wow.” Hellhound murmured. “You make it sound romantic.”</p>
<p>The Empress never looked at the guards. Her gaze was still fixed on
the red haired scavenger in front of her.</p>
<p>“Here for me?” She raised both eyebrows, then huffed. “Now you have
my attention.”</p>
<p>“Hellhound,” she spat the name with condescension. “Why are you
here?”</p>
<p>She stepped aside, gesturing towards the slaves tied up around her
throne.</p>
<p>“Most come here with money in their pockets, seeking the finest
slaves I have to offer.”</p>
<p>She turned back.</p>
<p>“But you don’t seem like my usual… clients. So why then?”</p>
<p>“I wanna work for you.”</p>
<p>One of the guards snorted behind Hellhound. Nyx scowled. For once,
Hellhound’s words didn’t drip with sarcasm.</p>
<p>A pause.</p>
<p>Nyx finally started walking, her boots breaking the long silence.</p>
<p>“You, a nameless scav, drag yourself here, on your own, to the
biggest raider faction in the whole region,” she sighed in disbelief.
She grabbed the leash of one of her slaves sitting next to her throne.
Then another. And another. Yanked them all forwards. “The Marauders, a
name built on slavekeeping,” she walked, dragging the slaves behind her,
jerking the bunched up leashes each time one tried to stand up from the
ground. “What makes you believe you’re not worth more to me as a
slave?”</p>
<p>Hellhound held her gaze fixed on the flame of the braziers. She took
a deep breath.</p>
<p>“Because I’d be a waste in chains.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>One of the warlords lounging next to Nyx’s throne snorted into his
drink, coughing as he laughed.</p>
<p>“You think that’s for you to decide?”</p>
<p>“Did I ever ask you?” Nyx turned slowly. The warlord raised his hands
and returned to his drink.</p>
<p>“A waste in chains,” Nyx repeated quietly.</p>
<p>A beat.</p>
<p>“Then you won’t mind earning your freedom from them.” She turned her
head slightly, and gestured towards the guards. “Get the cage
ready.”</p>
<p>Hellhound’s eyes followed the guards. Nyx handed the leashed slaves
to the guards, who then shoved them into a makeshift cage, a small,
pathetic arena.</p>
<p><em>Arena. Who would have thought. It always starts with an arena.
Every single time. But slaves, really?</em></p>
<p>“I assumed those weren’t throwaways?” Hellhound finally looked at
Nyx.</p>
<p>The Empress frowned at her. But she let her speak.</p>
<p>“Bloodhound trained me,” Hellhound added. That name seemed to have
weight here. The slaves being stuffed in the cage quietly begged for
mercy behind Nyx. She held her hand up to instruct the guards to stand
down, but kept her gaze on Hellhound.</p>
<p>“You’re just asking me to destroy your furniture.”</p>
<p><em>Her patience is running out, but if I just kill her slaves, she
will get angry. She thinks it will be a spectacle, but no, it won’t. It
will be boring, it will be humiliating, she will hate that. And now she
thinks I’m a smartass too, fantastic Lucy, keep rushing towards your
grave.</em></p>
<p>“You’re in no place to question my decision, scav.”</p>
<p>“Fine,” she shrugged. “But let me at least entertain you.”</p>
<p>“It will be entertaining enough to put the dog in her kennel. Get.
In.”</p>
<p>The cage wasn't big enough to let the slaves run or hide. It was
humiliating for all of them. But to be put in the same cage as some
filthy, starved slaves? As a raider? As Hellhound? Nyx was
underestimating her.</p>
<p>The slaves were fueled by adrenaline, the sheer will to survive yet
another horrible day as Nyx's toys. Maybe some drugs too. The air
reeked; it was hard to tell the sharp stench of stimulants apart from
sweat, blood, piss, and faces.</p>
<p>Three of them. Two men, one woman. All wrong.</p>
<p>Hellhound stepped inside the cage. The guards slammed the door shut
behind her.</p>
<p>She glanced at Nyx again, but now arrogance got the better of her.
Her expression was pure disgust and disappointment. A stubborn face that
said, <em>I wanted to prove myself and you're giving me crayons to
eat.</em></p>
<p>The slaves didn't look like much. Hollow, unfocused eyes, glancing at
each other. Uncertain, but visibly scared. But their minds weren't
clean. If they were, they wouldn't have looked at Hellhound like
potential food.</p>
<p>"Slaves." Nyx snapped her fingers. All three turned their heads
toward their Empress in unison. "Force her to the ground. If you do,
you're all granted freedom."</p>
<p>Hellhound snorted as she saw their eyes light up. <em>As if they had
a chance.</em></p>
<p>But her amusement was short-lived.</p>
<p>Two masked guards approached the cage with fumigators. With a label
painted on the tanks on their backs.</p>
<p>CN-47.</p>
<p><em>Fuck.</em></p>
<p>The small arena drowned in slightly pink fumes. It smelled sweet. It
tasted sweet.</p>
<p>The slaves got bolder. Their movements were twitchy. They got louder,
and paranoid.</p>
<p>The taller man slammed his fist against the bars of the cage. The
clang echoed. The woman cried out, shaking. They were still terrified.
But wrong. Deeply wrong.</p>
<p>Hellhound seemed to be calm. She wasn't twitchy. She tracked their
movement instead, watching which one would be bold enough to jump
first.</p>
<p>She knew the name.</p>
<p><em>CN-47. Cheap drug, and it's everywhere. Makes you unstable, makes
you see monsters, makes you want to crawl out of your own body.</em></p>
<p>Nyx crossed her arms, lips curling into a smile. She knew the gas
would set in soon, and they would attack each other. They would see
threats, beasts trying to take their lives. The thought of watching the
scavenger dog go rabid made her grin.</p>
<p>Except Hellhound didn't seem affected. Or she was hiding it too
well.</p>
<p>The Empress scowled. Hellhound wasn't only calm, she seemed to be
enjoying the fumes. Nyx leaned forward, narrowing her eyes, trying to
see her better.</p>
<p>Because Hellhound's eyes reflected the light even stronger now,
glowing like a predator's in the dark.</p>
<p>Hellhound inhaled deeply. She knew how it looked, like she was
showing off, but she couldn't help it. It felt right. It sharpened her
focus. And it bought her one more hour before the headache kicked
in.</p>
<p>The taller man finally broke the stillness and lunged. Hellhound
sidestepped, and he slammed into the cage wall.</p>
<p>Hellhound glanced at Nyx.</p>
<p><em>You want a show? You will get a show.</em></p>
<p>The woman thought she had the upper hand, catching Hellhound with her
back turned. She tried to tackle Hellhound, grab her arm, cling.</p>
<p>Hellhound jerked free and shoved the woman aside. The woman recovered
quickly, scuttled to the younger man huddled in the corner, grabbed his
shoulders, and shook him.</p>
<p>"We can pin her down," her breathing was heavy, desperate. "And then
we're free. Come on!"</p>
<p>The younger man trembled, searching the air, struggling to locate the
voice talking to him. Then his gaze snapped to the woman.</p>
<p>"No. No, we're gonna die." He looked down at his own hands. "I'm
already dying. CAN'T YOU SEE?"</p>
<p>Hellhound was disgusted.</p>
<p><em>This whole setup was working against her. She couldn't show off
her competence against three worms, no matter what she did.</em></p>
<p>She sighed.</p>
<p><em>If I don't hurry, they'll end up killing each other.</em></p>
<p>The taller man moved again, trying to pin Hellhound to the cage
wall.<br />
The woman jumped immediately after, claws and teeth bared.<br />
In the corner, the younger man collapsed, curled in on himself.</p>
<p>Hellhound caught the tall man by the arm and yanked him forward. As
he stumbled, she kicked the woman away.</p>
<p>The pistons in her prosthetic hissed, fingers clamping down on his
forearm, then the mechanism clicked shut as his bones shattered in her
grip.</p>
<p>He screamed, but didn't back down. He snapped for her shoulder.
Hellhound had to step back. The woman still managed to kick her in her
knee.</p>
<p>Nyx smiled. <em>Even the weakest put up a fight if given the right
motivation.</em></p>
<p>Hellhound let out a sharp huff through her nose.</p>
<p>The guards were ordered to poke the younger man curled in the corner,
to make him move. He suddenly reached out, trying to grab one of the
guards, begging to be let out. They answered by releasing more gas. They
wanted to cross Hellhound's tolerance limit.</p>
<p>Hellhound finally moved, tackling the tall man into the cage wall and
punching his face. The back of his head hit the bars so hard the metal
dented.</p>
<p>The woman rushed in immediately, trying to take Hellhound while she
was distracted. But they experienced time differently. Hellhound
shrugged her prosthetic free, turned, and caught the woman by the face.
Her metal claws locked in, the pistons started building pressure.</p>
<p>The slave tried to wiggle away, but the gas suppressed her senses.
She snapped at the metal arm, snarled, kicked, but her body was already
failing her.</p>
<p><em>She doesn't even see me anymore. Where's the fun in
that?</em></p>
<p>The pistons hissed. With a crunch, the woman's skull collapsed.
Hellhound let go and shook her hand off. Then she glanced at the younger
man.</p>
<p>He wasn't even looking at her. He couldn't even tell where she was.
He decided it was safer to cover his eyes.</p>
<p>"Please don't," he cried. "I don't want freedom, let me—" He gasped
for air, drowning in the gas. "Let me live, as a slave, I don't care,
just—"</p>
<p>Hellhound kicked him in the ribs. He doubled over, curling on the
ground.</p>
<p>"You don't even know what you're begging to." She kicked him again.
The man yelped.</p>
<p>"You don't even see me." Another kick.</p>
<p>"And you'd still sell yourself to anything." Another.</p>
<p>"Even to nothing?"</p>
<p>She stomped on his head.</p>
<p>His body went stiff, then still. Stopped moving. Stopped begging. No
more noise.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Mercy?” The Empress laughed, low and amused. “Interesting
choice.”</p>
<p>Hellhound snorted.</p>
<p>“Most wouldn’t call this mercy.” She dusted herself off casually.
“But I’m glad we’re on the same page.” She lifted her head. “So?” A
pause. “May I leave the cage, Empress?”</p>
<p>She drew the word out, just mockingly enough not to get her head
taken instantly.</p>
<p>Nyx nodded to the guards. They opened the cage door and let Hellhound
walk out.</p>
<p>The Empress gestured to Hellhound.</p>
<p>“Come. This is no place to talk.” She grinned, then smacked her
shoulder. “You’ve earned a drink with me.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The bar was noisy in every way. People shouting, loud but awful
music, the overwhelming smell of sweat and alcohol, <em>and lights.</em>
Disgusting, irregular bright stripes of colors flickering in the dark,
making it impossible to adjust. Hellhound winced and scrunched her nose,
eyes narrowing like each flicker of light was poking her in the
head.</p>
<p>The Empress herself was now walking by her side, leading her in,
showing her around. The crowd parted the moment Nyx approached them,
giving her space, never standing in her way.</p>
<p>She had reputation. Even in raider standards, it was unusual to see
this amount of respect for one ultimate ruler. True authority rooted in
fear, respect and charisma. It didn’t rely on loyalty, it produced
it.</p>
<p>Nyx cleared a table and sat down. Hellhound followed.</p>
<p>"Rum or whiskey, Hellhound?"</p>
<p>"Rum. Dark."</p>
<p>"Of course."</p>
<p>Nyx waved to one of the raiders. Not long after, two bottles were set
on the table. Thick glass. Dark rum and whiskey resting inside like
something preserved on purpose. The kind you didn't pour unless you
wanted something.</p>
<p>"So, Hellhound." She poured a glass of rum. The color was rich,
almost like honey. "I'll admit, you surprised me with that last
slave."</p>
<p>She poured herself whiskey.</p>
<p>"I thought you'd spare him." She slid the rum across. "You looked
like the type who would resent killing someone who doesn't fight
back."</p>
<p>Hellhound reached for the glass. She let the rum swirl slowly, then
raised it, met Nyx's gaze for a moment, nodded, and took a single
sip.</p>
<p>"I wanted to spare him only because he was your property." Hellhound
inhaled sharp, appreciating the rum biting her tongue. "But he was
begging to be kept alive as a slave."</p>
<p>Nyx hummed, nursing her drink.</p>
<p>"So if he didn't beg, you would've valued him more?"</p>
<p>"No." Hellhound set her glass down. "You see, the problem isn't the
begging. He wasn't present anymore. He couldn't see me, couldn't
understand what was happening."</p>
<p>She swirled the rum, watching the liquid move.</p>
<p>"And yet he was begging to be owned."</p>
<p>The Empress let the whiskey sit on her tongue. She raised an
eyebrow.</p>
<p>"The reason we keep slaves is because they're still people."
Hellhound stared at her glass. "Agency. Loyalty. Desire. All of that is
still there, even when it's broken in."</p>
<p>She glanced up.</p>
<p>"But does someone still qualify as a person when they don't even know
who they submit to? When they're begging to the concept of ownership
itself?"</p>
<p>Nyx narrowed her eyes. Hellhound held her gaze.</p>
<p>"At that point, he didn't just lose his value as a person." She
smiled. "He lost his value as a slave too. Who'd want to own a shell of
submission calling itself human?"</p>
<p>Nyx smirked. Set her glass down. Leaned back and crossed her
arms.</p>
<p>"So you decided he wasn't worth being mine?"</p>
<p>Hellhound went still.</p>
<p>Checkmate.</p>
<p>Again.</p>
<p>Nyx clocked it. Grinned. Refilled Hellhound's glass.</p>
<p>"Would you have done the same if they weren't mine?"</p>
<p>Hellhound's fingers tightened briefly around her glass. She didn't
look away.</p>
<p>"Yeah." A pause. "But with less hesitation about angering you." She
tipped the glass back, took a short sip, set it down harder than
necessary. "I would've killed them all with a single blow. They were
boring as hell." Her nose scrunched. "Insulting."</p>
<p>Nyx watched her over the rim of her glass, eyes half-lidded.</p>
<p>"If I told you that bored me, what would you change next time?"</p>
<p>Hellhound let out a sharp breath through her nose. She leaned back
slightly, one arm draped over the chair.</p>
<p>"I'd ask for a better test, Empress." She met Nyx's gaze. "You know
damn well that was humiliation, not a proper cage fight. If you want me
to show off, give me a proper playground."</p>
<p>Nyx hummed, amused. The sound lingered as she rolled the whiskey once
in her glass, then finished it in one swallow.</p>
<p>"Tomorrow," she said, setting the empty glass aside, "you're getting
your playground, Hellhound."</p>
<p>She rose from her chair, already turning away.</p>
<p>"I'll take you somewhere special."</p>
<p><figure class="inline-illustration"><img src="../../media/F_01_nyx_lucy_bar.webp" alt="F_01_nyx_lucy_bar"></figure></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hellhound watched Nyx walk away. She could finally exhale. No more
guards breathing down her neck, no more performing. She stared at her
glass, still half filled with rum. Nyx had left both bottles on the
table. Probably intentionally.</p>
<p>She finally let herself lean back in the chair and look around. The
bar was filled with Marauders. Most were busy with cards or stupid, loud
raider games. Others found amusement in staring at the newcomer.</p>
<p>She huffed. She was used to people staring. Her eyes made Hellhound a
spectacle wherever she went.</p>
<p>The lights didn’t bother her much anymore. She felt numb. Too numb to
care. She nursed her drink and let her brain switch off for a moment. No
noise. No lights. No thoughts.</p>
<p>The calm didn’t last.</p>
<p>Nausea crept in, followed by a dull headache. It was hard to tell
whether it came from the stress, the lights, or withdrawal. Probably all
three. She downed the rest of her drink and pushed the glass aside,
already shifting to stand.</p>
<p><em>Gear’s still confiscated. Just essentials.<br />
Drugs are on me.<br />
Could find a room.<br />
I’ll wait for Nyx to give my gear back.<br />
If they want to give it back.</em></p>
<p>“Mind if I sit?”</p>
<p>Hellhound’s gaze snapped up.</p>
<p>A masked man stood beside the table. His outfit was… elegant. Too
elegant for a raider bar. If not for the mask, she wouldn’t have clocked
him as one of them at all.</p>
<p>A tuxedo? Here?</p>
<p>The mask sold it. Either someone deeply committed to looking
frightening, or someone who had more to hide than he could afford to
show.</p>
<p>“Suit yourself,” Hellhound shrugged.</p>
<p>He sat down across from her without crowding the table. A small
courtesy. Noted. He lifted two fingers toward the bartender.</p>
<p>“One glass of water.”</p>
<p>Hellhound blinked. “Water? Bold.”</p>
<p>“What can I say. Some days I let myself indulge.”</p>
<p>He leaned back as the bartender approached, uncorked a bottle, and
poured the water into a wine glass like it mattered. The man nodded once
and slid a single red token across the counter.</p>
<p>Hellhound squinted at it. “What’s that?”</p>
<p>“Water.”</p>
<p>She groaned before she could stop herself. The man snorted, shoulders
twitching with a quiet laugh.</p>
<p>“You’re new here, aren’t you.”</p>
<p>“That so obvious?”</p>
<p>Instead of answering, he reached into his pocket and placed a few
more of the same red tokens on the table. He picked one up and spun it
between his fingers, then set it rolling in a slow circle.</p>
<p>“Marauder marks,” he said. “We get paid in these.”</p>
<p>Hellhound watched the token wobble, then fall flat. “How do I get
those?”</p>
<p>“Well,” he said, folding his hands around his glass, “you don’t. Not
unless you’re working for Nyx.”</p>
<p>Hellhound reached for the rum bottle and refilled her glass, spilling
a little onto the table. She didn’t bother wiping it up. Across from
her, the man took another measured sip of water, holding the glass like
it was the finest thing he’d tasted all day.</p>
<p>“Still accepting drugs though, I assume?”</p>
<p>The bar developed a mild but persistent tilt, but she sipped her
drink anyway.</p>
<p>“Holy, Nyx has some nice drinks.”</p>
<p>The man huffed in amusement.</p>
<p>“Depends on the person, really. Most do.”</p>
<p>Hellhound squinted up at him.<br />
“Why’d you want to sit with me?”</p>
<p>He snorted.</p>
<p>“Short answer, you were alone, and I’m a gentleman who also happened
to be alone.” He took another sip of water.<br />
“Long answer, look around.”</p>
<p>He gestured vaguely behind himself.</p>
<p>“You’ve got the whole bar’s attention. Newcomer, weird eyes, and for
some reason, Nyx’s company.” He paused, then lowered his voice as he
leaned in a little closer.</p>
<p>“And more importantly… Nyx’s favor.”</p>
<p>He finally set his glass down and folded his hands together.</p>
<p>“So. What’s your name?”</p>
<p>“Hellhound. Yours?”</p>
<p>“Skull.”</p>
<p>Hellhound snorted.<br />
“Wow. Very creative.”</p>
<p>“Better than your fantasy name, Cerberus.”</p>
<p>“Excuse you. My name comes from my mentor, Bloodhound. And Hell
because I like fire.”</p>
<p>“Bloodhound?” He tilted his head. “Interesting. And what do you mean
you like fire?”</p>
<p>“Burning things down. Or just watching it. Depends on my mood.”</p>
<p>“Flashy.” He smiled faintly behind the mask. “I prefer it dark and
silent. Easier to hunt.”<br />
Then he added, almost idly, “Though I won’t lie. I can imagine you must
look ethereal, those eyes reflecting firelight.”</p>
<p>Hellhound froze. She hadn’t anticipated flirting. It didn’t matter
anyway; nobody could tell whether the warmth creeping up her face was
from that or the alcohol.</p>
<p>“Speaking of eyes,” he continued. “Why are yours like that?”</p>
<p>“Drugs.” She blurted it out, regretted it instantly, then explained
anyway. “I don’t understand half of it, but taking them makes my eyes
brighter.”</p>
<p>“Aren’t you worried about turning?”</p>
<p>That snapped Hellhound out of her tipsy haze. That wasn’t a question
she was allowed to answer.</p>
<p>“I know my limits.”</p>
<p>“Interesting.” He brushed his fingers against the edge of his mask.
“I thought drugs made eye color fade, not deepen.”</p>
<p>He reached for his glass and drained the rest of his water.</p>
<p>“You’re strange, Hellhound. But I’m sure you already know that.”</p>
<p>He stood and turned to leave.</p>
<p>“Wait—before you go,” Hellhound said quickly, louder than she meant
to. “Any place you’d recommend for food?”</p>
<p>Skull huffed a laugh and glanced back over his shoulder.</p>
<p>“There’s a stall in the market. Pete’s Delicacies. I always eat
there.”</p>
<p>Then he walked away.</p>
<p>Hellhound grabbed the two bottles Nyx had left on the table and left
the bar. The world tilted slightly, but she’d manage.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hellhound was a sight. One rum bottle and one whiskey bottle in each
hand.<br />
A little tipsy, but still walking straight enough as she searched for
the market.</p>
<p><em>Need to eat. Need to clear my head, then dose.<br />
There it is. Market. Something like that.</em></p>
<p>She passed stall after stall, scanning for the one Skull had
mentioned.</p>
<p>After asking exactly three people for directions, forgetting half of
what they said, then asking someone else one last time, she finally
found it.</p>
<p><strong>Pete’s Delicacies.</strong></p>
<p>Two long metal trays sat on display; one piled with massive, raw
slabs of meat, the other filled with roasted cuts that looked
dangerously appetizing, both sealed beneath glass lids.</p>
<p>“Just give me something good.”</p>
<p>The trader squinted at her.<br />
“You sure about that, bud? You don’t look too sober.”</p>
<p>“Oh shut up,” she said. “Just let me eat something.”</p>
<p>He shrugged. “Fine. You got marks?”</p>
<p>“Not from here. I’ve got drugs, though.”</p>
<p>“Nah, that won’t work here.” His eyes flicked to the bottles in her
hands. “Those fancy bottles, though. Might cover a few cuts.”</p>
<p>“That’s from Nyx,” Hellhound snapped. “I’m not trading her gift. I’d
rather starve.”</p>
<p>“Well, too bad for you,” he said easily. “Drugs won’t cover human
meat.”</p>
<p>Hellhound’s gaze snapped up.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>Oh.<br />
Oh holy fuck.</em></p>
<p>The trader caught the moment it clicked and burst out laughing.</p>
<p>“Who sent you here?” he asked. “You already making enemies?”</p>
<p>“A guy with a mask,” Hellhound said faintly. “Skull mask. Called
himself Skull.” She snorted at the irony.</p>
<p>“Of course he did.” The trader shook his head. “He’s one of my
regulars.”</p>
<p>Hellhound’s mind stalled as the pieces snapped together. The mask.
The hunting. The questions about drugs.<br />
She dragged her hand down her face and groaned.</p>
<p>The trader laughed again, watching her reboot in real time.<br />
“You’ll have better luck listening to anyone but old Skull’s taste in
food.”<br />
Then he slid the glass lid back into place.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She dragged herself deeper into the market, looking for stalls that
sold actual food. The bottles were getting annoying to carry, and she
genuinely started questioning whether it would’ve been better to just
sell them.</p>
<p>She was sobering up, her thoughts slowly snapping back into order.
She tried asking around, gathering information about where to get a
room, or which food vendors people recommended <strong>for
non-cannibals</strong>.</p>
<p>The rest of the day went alright.</p>
<p>Hellhound ended up with a full belly and a room to herself, the two
glass bottles very much safe and intact. The door locked behind her.
Surrounded by walls, she finally let herself breathe. This was as close
as she could get to safety and peace.</p>
<p>And fucking <em>finally</em>, she controlled the lights.</p>
<p>The first thing she did was close the shutters, plunging the room
into darkness. Her nervous system craved it.</p>
<p>As soon as the calm settled in, her headache flared. Routine. She let
herself fall onto the bed, staring up at the ceiling. The pain spiked
the moment her head hit the mattress, but it didn’t bother her. It was
expected. It was how her system worked.</p>
<p>She raised her right arm, the metal prosthetic housing a glass vial
at the inside of her wrist. The liquid inside swirled with the sudden
movement.</p>
<p>Her ears started ringing. Her vision narrowed. Everything around the
vial began to swim, blurry and vibrant, floaters blooming like cracks in
her sight. Through them leaked a wrong kaleidoscope, static, vibrant
colors, never settling long enough to form a pattern. Always slipping to
the edges of her vision. Always fleeing, never gone.</p>
<p>When it reached the center, she closed her eyes.</p>
<p>Her head throbbed. Her flesh arm was numb up to the shoulder. The
world spun around her.<br />
But she was calm.</p>
<p>Then the pistons hissed. The injector advanced one unit.</p>
<p>She let out a shaky exhale. And waited.</p>
<p>This was the best part. Feeling safe enough to deliberately let the
symptoms worsen, then feeling the dose undo them one by one. It wasn’t
the easing pain that calmed her, but the certainty of it. The pain was
as expected as the relief that followed.</p>
<p>Proof that her system, even with all its expected errors, worked
exactly the way she knew it would.</p>
<p>Following rules. Never breaking them. Perfectly predictable.</p>
<p>She didn’t remember dosing off; her mind simply shut off. She sat up
so suddenly she almost fell off the bed.</p>
<p>She had plans for sunset. Perfect time to look around with less
people around.</p>
<p>She rubbed her eyes, gave her own cheeks two quick smacks to wake
herself up. Then she jumped on her feet, shook her arms off and walked
outside.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Her gait changed. She finally let herself look around, hold her gaze
high, admire the sky, the makeshift buildings, the uniqueness of each
shack.</p>
<p>It was fascinating, seeing how scavenged materials had been
repurposed.</p>
<p><em>Who in their right mind drags a whole-ass bus frame just to use
it as support?</em><br />
<em>Sound barrier panels from highways as walls? Damn, that’s
clever.</em><br />
<em>Wing spars as support beams. Stupid. That whole thing’s going to
bend itself to death.</em><br />
<em>Floodgate as a door? Dramatic, aren’t we.</em></p>
<p>She stopped at a fireplace spot surrounded by benches. The sun had
dropped low enough to mess with Hellhound’s eyes. Shadows blurred into
that awkward middle ground between bright and dark, the kind that forced
you to squint just to make sense of your surroundings.</p>
<p>Her heating coils were already humming. Chopped firewood sat stacked
in place, waiting. The coils glowed red in the dim light, distracting
contrast against the gathering darkness. The thought of firelight felt
sweeter than it should have.</p>
<p>She pressed her knuckles against the wood.</p>
<p>The slightly wet logs whined against the coils. She loved the sound
of water hissing at her, protesting as it was forced into steam. The
wood sizzled, crying against her hand.</p>
<p>White smoke curled upward, a thin ribbon holding its shape as it
danced into the dark.</p>
<p>Hellhound watched the surface blacken, char slowly spreading. With
her flesh arm she grabbed a handful of twigs, pressed them against her
metal fingers, and watched them burst into flame. She slid them between
the logs.</p>
<p>The charred edge finally lit. The flame grew steady, licking along
the wood, evicting what moisture remained. The first low pops of the
fire sent a shiver through her. They were her favorite sounds in this
world.</p>
<p>She forgot to pull her arm away.</p>
<p>But it didn’t matter. She turned her hand, stretching her fingers.
She loved letting the flames caress her fingers. That arm let her
interact with the only thing she truly trusted.</p>
<p>She curled her fingers, imagining she caressed the flames back. As if
they liked it and they wanted more.</p>
<p>She was absolutely mesmerized.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>A sound she never heard before snapped her out of the magic. Dry
rattling, like carved wood clinking together, but uneven, off-tone.</p>
<p>She went on high alert, but didn’t turn around. The fire had grown
larger, engulfing her whole hand up to the wrist.</p>
<p>Her pistons hissed again. A tiny movement, barely visible. The
injector advanced another unit.</p>
<p>Her eyes were unfocused now, fixed on the flames. Her body stayed
still, listening. Muscles coiled. Breathing slow and steady.</p>
<p>Dirt crunched right behind her.</p>
<p>She launched her prosthetic in a curved arc, her whole body turning
with the momentum, dragging the flames with it. Her fist connected, the
metal scythe snapped in half before it could reach her neck.</p>
<p>The figure staggered back, dropped the broken handle, and pulled a
knife into his grip.</p>
<p>Same mask. Skull.</p>
<p>A wide smirk crept up Hellhound’s face.</p>
<p>“What a gentleman,” she murmured with poison in her tone. “Hungry
already?”</p>
<p>He tilted his head, cracked his neck once.</p>
<p>“Told you I wanted to see those eyes in the firelight.”</p>
<p>She flashed her teeth with a grin, curled and uncurled her fingers,
letting the mechanism warm up and the pistons click in place with
pressure.</p>
<p>“This?” She glanced at the flames crawling up the logs. “Really?”</p>
<p>He lunged.</p>
<p>Fast. Too fast for most people. Not for her.</p>
<p>Hellhound drifted out of the line like it was nothing. Not even a
clean dodge, more like her body refused to be where the blade wanted
her. She laughed.</p>
<p>Again. He stabbed the air. She slipped away.</p>
<p>She circled him. Her movements were unpredictable. The glow of her
coils dragged red streaks through the dark like a trail begging to be
followed. Skull adjusted. Tried to lead her. Tried to bait her into the
open.</p>
<p>She kicked the fire.</p>
<p>Charred logs rolled, sparks exploded. One slammed into the edge of a
bench. The dry wood slowly caught fire, flame crawling up the wood
leg.</p>
<p>“Shit,” she muttered, delighted. “That was quick.”</p>
<p>She jumped onto the burning bench and crouched low, her claws
disengaging.</p>
<p>“You’re rushing,” she said. “That’s how you hunt? Desperate?”</p>
<p>Skull’s knife left his hand. It flew straight for her throat.</p>
<p>Hellhound snapped her prosthetic up on reflex. Metal hit metal. She
blocked it.</p>
<p>The shotgun came up immediately. He fired.</p>
<p>But Hellhound was gone.</p>
<p>“Boring,” she said from behind, almost whining.</p>
<p>The fire spread. One bench was fully engulfed in flames, another one
lit up too. The contrast made perception confusing: pitch black beyond
the firelight, then sudden bright, then black again. Shadows jumped
around, playing cruel tricks on the eye.</p>
<p>Skull fired into movement. Into reflections. Into heat shimmer that
looked like a moving body for half a second.</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>Hellhound lunged straight through the flames.</p>
<p>Skull ducked her first swing on instinct, felt heat wash over his
head. Her fist hit the shipping container behind him instead. She
punched a hole through the metal.</p>
<p>Skull tried to sidestep. She didn’t let him.</p>
<p>Hellhound slammed into him shoulder-first and drove him down into the
fire. The shotgun clattered from his grip, skidding across dirt.</p>
<p>His coat ignited immediately.</p>
<p>He shoved her off, rolled, and tore the burning coat away mid-motion,
scrambling clear.</p>
<p>Too slow.</p>
<p>Hellhound was already on him again.</p>
<p>Her claws closed around his mask, pistons whining and tightening. The
edge of the mask blackened from the heat of the coils. The pressure
built. A crack. Then another.</p>
<p>Then floodlights snapped on. Guards shouting. Guns up.</p>
<p>Both of them were at gunpoint now.</p>
<p>Hellhound glanced at Skull one last time. Tightened her grip just
enough to make him feel how little it would take to crush his face. Then
she let go.</p>
<p>Her hands shook. Her whole body shook. Not from fear. She groaned and
raised her arms in frustration, breathing hard.</p>
<p>A guard lunged to pin her down.</p>
<p>She punched through his arm, heat chewing through leather and then
flesh. He screamed, dropped his gun. The others opened fire.</p>
<p>Hellhound bolted into the dark.</p>
<p>“STAND THE FUCK DOWN!”</p>
<p><em>…Nyx.</em></p>
<p>The gunfire stuttered and stopped. Weapons stayed raised.</p>
<p>“HELLHOUND,” she yelled. “DOG, GET YOUR ASS HERE.”</p>
<p>Movement behind them.</p>
<p>Nyx turned.</p>
<p>A guard dropped. Hellhound crushed his throat. He couldn’t even
scream. Just simply twitched and collapsed.</p>
<p>Hellhound stepped in front of her and cocked her head.</p>
<p>“Not. A. Dog,” Hellhound snarled.</p>
<p>“Curious,” Nyx sneered and wrapped her fingers around Hellhound’s
throat. “You still moved to my legs.”</p>
<p>Hellhound’s jaw clenched. Her claws kept curling and uncurling. But
she didn’t move.</p>
<p>Nyx didn’t order the guards to shoot either.</p>
<p>Not yet.</p>
<p>The Empress glanced at the guards.</p>
<p>“Scatter,” she gestured. “I will handle this one.”</p>
<p>She grabbed Hellhound’s metal arm and yanked her wrist forward. Then
she inspected the half empty vial.</p>
<p>“Pyra?” She huffed. “How much?”</p>
<p>Hellhound was silent. She tilted her head, then jerked it back. Then
held up two fingers, still shaking.</p>
<p>“Two shots.” She let her head fall back too look up at her, bobbing a
little.</p>
<p>Nyx’s eyes narrowed.</p>
<p>“And yet you can still think?”</p>
<p>Nyx didn’t wait for an answer. She tightened her grip on Hellhounds
wrist, jerked her forward and dragged her away to her church. Hellhound
didn’t resist.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Nyx kicked her forward.<br />
Hellhound stumbled, hit the stone hard, and dropped to her knees.<br />
She stayed there. Head down. Hands flat against the floor.</p>
<p>“What,” Hellhound snarled, “you thought I’d just let him have his way
with me? Offer myself up on a silver platter?”</p>
<p>Nyx circled her, then stopped in front of her. Hellhound did not look
up. The Empress raised one boot and placed it on Hellhounds right
shoulder.</p>
<p>“I don’t care.”</p>
<p>She shifted her weight on that leg. Hellhound felt the pressure, but
held her ground.</p>
<p>“You’re nobody here.” Nyx leaned into it. “And you think I’ll
tolerate a dog wasting my resources?”</p>
<p>The pressure vanished.</p>
<p>Then the kick came.</p>
<p>Hellhound went onto her back. Stone slammed into her spine. She
sucked in air and kept her eyes anywhere but Nyx. The walls. The
braziers. The slaves watching.</p>
<p>Nyx stepped over her.</p>
<p>The boot came down again. This time on Hellhound’s right shoulder.
Harder.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She could reach Nyx’s leg. It was right there. She could hook it,
twist, break the shin. Pyra still burned in her veins. But she knew
better. It wasn’t an option.</p>
<p>“I ordered my guards to stand down,” Nyx said. “Do you know what they
think now?”</p>
<p>“That I’m your favorite?” Hellhound spat.</p>
<p>“That you’re special.”</p>
<p>Nyx’s other boot pressed down on Hellhound’s neck, just above the
collarbone. Not choking yet, but claiming her space.</p>
<p>“We don’t do special here.”</p>
<p>Nyx bent down, balancing herself on Hellhound’s prosthetic arm. She
grabbed the wrist and twisted it outward.</p>
<p>“Unless someone deserves my attention.”</p>
<p>The pull was sudden. The delicate metal parts broke free with a
horrifying screech.</p>
<p>Hellhound’s eyes flew open. Her body surged upward on instinct.</p>
<p>Nyx shoved her back down with her boot.</p>
<p>Hellhound gasped. Her shoulder screamed, her balance was wrong.
Everything was wrong. Her vision blurred and she suddenly felt
nauseous.</p>
<p>Nyx lifted the detached arm by the wrist. Turned it once. Inspected
the injector.</p>
<p>Hellhound’s breathing went frantic; she couldn’t hold back the
panic.</p>
<p>“No,” her voice tripped over her own breath. “You have to give that
back,” she gasped with shaking voice.<br />
“You have no idea—”</p>
<p>“Oh, I very much have some ideas.” Nyx tilted the arm, watching the
fluid shift inside the vial.<br />
“I’m just going to test them one by one.”</p>
<p>“No… No, you’re gonna kill me without that arm,” Hellhound snarled,
but that halfway turned into a shaky whine.<br />
She quickly shook her head, then gasped for air. “Give it back. Please.
Nyx—”</p>
<p>“You’ll manage. Take it as a…” Nyx turned away, waving the arm.
“Compensation for property damage.”</p>
<p>“Now,” She glanced back.</p>
<p>“Get out.”</p>
