CHAPTER III – MUZZLELOCK</h1>
<p>The road south hadn’t decided what it wanted to be.</p>
<p>Cracked asphalt gave way to dirt, then gravel, then back to asphalt
again, each transition announcing itself by trying to throw Hellhound
off her bike. The desert stretched flat and sun-bleached on both sides,
ruins and dust and nothing but emptiness, the skeleton of a city slumped
on the horizon, jaw hanging open. A few rusted hulks of old vehicles sat
half-buried in the roadside dirt like they’d just given up mid-journey.
She understood the impulse.</p>
<p>She hit a rough patch and her front wheel stuttered sideways.</p>
<p>Her left hand wrenched the handlebar straight. Her right shoulder
swung forward on reflex, weight shifting, the automatic counterbalance
her body had run off for years — and caught nothing. No pistons. No
grip. Just empty air and the horrible lightness of it, and three very
long seconds of the bike threatening to go out from under her before she
hauled it back with her left arm screaming.</p>
<p>She eased off the throttle. Let the gap open up between her and Nyx’s
rear wheel while she nursed the bike over the broken stretch at a pace
that insulted her personally.</p>
<p>Nyx glanced back.</p>
<p>“Scenic route, dog?”</p>
<p>Hellhound laughed. Short, sharp and genuine enough that Nyx couldn’t
do anything with it, and she buried the actual feeling underneath it
before it had time to show on her face. The actual feeling being the
specific humiliation of her own body failing to do something it had done
ten thousand times without thought, because some piece of it was
currently clipped to an empress’s belt like a hunting trophy.</p>
<p><em>Funny. Hilarious even.</em></p>
<p>She opened the throttle and closed the gap.</p>
<p>The road flattened out and her shoulders dropped half an inch. She
stretched her fingers, curled them, and stretched them again. Her
missing right hand tried to follow out of habit.</p>
<p>“Plainside,” Nyx said, facing forward again, her voice carrying clean
over the engine noise. Casual. Like she was narrating a tour. “Farming
settlement, thirty-odd residents. Closer to twenty now, probably. Had a
pregnant woman and five elders last time my people did a count. Elders
are likely gone.” A pause. “They sit right inside my watchtower range.
Nothing moves near them I don’t know about.”</p>
<p>“Good position.”</p>
<p>“Immaculate position.” Something in Nyx’s tone made the word land
differently than it should. “Which means their taxes reflect that.
Monthly quota. Flexible. I account for seasons, bad yields, problems
with the herd. I’m not unreasonable.”</p>
<p>Hellhound hit another rut, the bike fishtailing on loose dirt, and
she swore under her breath and rode it out through gritted teeth.</p>
<p>“Careful,” Nyx called back, although deeply unbothered.</p>
<p>“I AM being careful,” Hellhound called back, which was technically
true and also completely beside the point.</p>
<p>She caught up again. The road smoothed into a long straight and she
exhaled properly for the first time in several minutes, hand steady on
the throttle, the desert sliding past in her periphery like it had
somewhere better to be.</p>
<p>“So what did they send?”</p>
<p>“Two iron grazers.” Nyx let that sit for a second. “Cut up. Thighs
kept for themselves. Organs included, I’ll give them that.”</p>
<p>“That’s it?”</p>
<p>“Few sacks of potatoes. Beets. Grains. Short by a half. No fruit.”
Another pause, more loaded than the last. “Fruit season is visibly,
obviously here. I could see their trees from my walls. Yet, not even
jams. Not even preserved stock. Barely any flour.”</p>
<p>Hellhound’s thumb tapped the throttle.</p>
<p>“And.” Nyx’s voice was the most pleasant it had been all morning. “As
compensation for the shortfall. They sent compost.”</p>
<p>Hellhound’s tapping stopped.</p>
<p>A long beat.</p>
<p>“...Compost.”</p>
<p>“Mm.”</p>
<p>“They sent you compost.”</p>
<p>“A generous quantity of it, yes.”</p>
<p>Hellhound stared at the road ahead of her and said nothing for a
moment, then started laughing, genuine, sharp and loud.</p>
<p>“So you’re going to encourage them,” she said, when she got her
breath back.</p>
<p>“Mhm.”</p>
<p>“And by encourage,” She glanced over. “Do you kill them?”</p>
<p>Nyx laughed. Bright and easy, like the question delighted her. “Kill
them? That’s stupid<em>.</em> Can’t tax a corpse.”</p>
<p>“Could tax whoever moves in after.”</p>
<p>“I could. Takes time. Inefficient.” She shook her head slowly, the
smile still in her voice. “No, the problem is farmers are stubborn. And
dumb. They sit inside my walls long enough, get safe, get fed, get
comfortable — and they start thinking they’re <em>necessary.</em> That I
am the one depending on them. That they’re irreplaceable, as if one farm
matters to me, that I’d—” A quiet scoff. “They don’t understand the size
of what I run. Levelling Plainside wouldn’t register. It would be a
Tuesday.”</p>
<p>“But they forgot that.”</p>
<p>“They forgot that. Peace does something to people. Protection does
it. You give someone safety long enough and they start treating it like
a right<em>.</em> They take it for granted. Like it has nothing to do
with me and everything to do with them.” She shrugged one shoulder, the
spikes catching the early dim light. “And then they get ideas. That they
can push back. That resistance is justified. That they could have it
better.”</p>
<p>Hellhound’s thumb started tapping again.</p>
<p>She was quiet for a moment. The city ruins drifted past on her left,
hollow windows staring out at nothing, some upper floor collapsed
inward, a whole building just kneeling in slow defeat.</p>
<p>“People always do that,” she said. “Get used to good things. The
longer something works, the more they stop seeing it as something that
was <em>built.</em> Something that can be taken. It just becomes...” She
gestured vaguely with her left hand, immediately had to grab the
handlebar again as the bike wobbled. “Background. Normal. And normal
things feel permanent. Permanent things feel unconditional.” She shook
her head. “And unconditional things don’t have rules anymore in their
heads. The rules just... dissolve.”</p>
<p>Nyx hummed.</p>
<p>Something shifted in Hellhound’s chest. The low simmer that had been
running under the conversation since compost suddenly climbed a
degree.</p>
<p>“So let me get this right.” Her voice changed. Still controlled, but
only just. “They’re in a system that <em>bends their way.</em> Flexible
quotas, seasonal accounting, no rising expectations — that’s not even
how it worked with my previous gang, if they missed quotas,” she laughed
in disbelief. “We just killed them. We took everything.” She huffed
through her nose, sharp. “These farmers have it <em>spoiled.</em> They
have it <em>good.</em> And they look at you taking their bad seasons as
an ‘it happens,’ giving them room, being <em>reasonable</em> — and they
read that as an <em>invitation?”</em></p>
<p>She started laughing, but it wasn’t the helpless kind from earlier.
This one had an edge to it.</p>
<p>“Do they actually think you depend on them?” Her voice climbed
slightly, almost hysterical. “That you would notice if one farm burns?
Do they forget they are sitting inside raider territory? Do they forget
whom they’re dealing with?” Her left hand clenched on the handlebar,
knuckles going pale. “They think mercy is something to exploit. They
think patience is a leash they can pull.”</p>
<p>She was breathing harder now. The bike swayed and she corrected it
without thinking, the correction automatic and too sharp, and she didn’t
care.</p>
<p>“They think they’re a defining function in your system.” The word
came out like a slur. “They’re not. They’re variables. Input. They give,
the system runs, they receive, the whole thing holds — but the moment a
variable decides it gets to rewrite the equation—” She laughed again,
that sharp unhinged sound. “You know what a good system does to
errors?”</p>
<p>She looked over at Nyx. Her eyes were too bright. Her jaw was tight,
her whole face pulled into something that probably looked insane and she
was aware of that and she did not currently have the capacity to do
anything about it.</p>
<p>“It self-corrects,” she said. “Identifies the error. Removes it. And
the system keeps running.”</p>
<p>The shiver hit her mid-sentence.</p>
<p>Her left hand was still clenched. Her head dropped slightly, chin
toward her chest. She was grinning. She could feel herself grinning and
she shook her head once, because she had no other response to what was
happening inside her skull right now, the white-clean clarity of it, the
almost unbearable rightness—</p>
<p>She blinked hard.</p>
<p>Her eyes were wet. One streak down her left cheek, caught by the wind
before it got anywhere.</p>
<p>She didn’t wipe it. Didn’t acknowledge it. Just stared at the road
with her jaw working silently, her shoulders still shivering slightly
and waited for the wave to pass.</p>
<p>Nyx had looked back.</p>
<p>Hellhound didn’t look over.</p>
<p>After a moment, Nyx said, “So I take it you’d kill them.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t really a question. But Hellhound’s head came up anyway, and
something in her expression shifted — the shiver settling, the clarity
landing, the answer sitting in her chest so clean and obvious it almost
bored her.</p>
<p>“Yes,” she said. Simply. “It wouldn’t matter, would it. Others would
move into the farm, present themselves — ones that haven’t already
proven they want to test the system.” She rolled her left wrist, bent it
back, held it. “A problem that knows it’s faulty can be corrected. A
problem that thinks it’s right—” She exhaled through her nose. “That
thinks it’s outplaying the system, that thinks it’s above it — that’s
rot. Error that should not exist.”</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>“Remove it. Let the system self-correct. It’s just maintenance.”</p>
<p>She glanced down at her left hand on the throttle.</p>
<p>There was blood on her index finger. She’d scratched the skin clean
off just under the knuckle at some point without noticing.</p>
<p>“...Fuck,” she muttered.</p>
<p>The road stretched ahead of them, ugly and sun-bleached, the ruins
falling behind, desert opening up on both sides.</p>
<p>Nyx rode in silence for a moment. The axe strapped to the side of the
bike. The belt-fed gun on her bike caught the light.</p>
<p>“We’ll see their proposal,” Nyx said finally. “Then we decide how to
punish them.”</p>
<p><em>We,</em> Hellhound noted, distantly.</p>
<p>She said nothing. Faced the road. Her finger throbbed.</p>
<p><em>We.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The older man’s name was Garrett. He’d introduced himself somewhere
in the first five minutes, the reflex politeness of someone scared and
trying to seem reasonable. He had the hands of someone who’d worked this
land for decades and the eyes of someone who hadn’t slept well in
months.</p>
<p>Hellhound had noted all of this and filed it under irrelevant.</p>
<p>Nyx stood with her weight on one hip, sawed-off loose on her thigh,
and let Garrett talk. He’d been talking for a while. The crowd behind
him had grown — twenty-odd people in various states of morning
dishevelment, children hovering at the edges, a few older faces in
doorways. The sun was creeping now, the temperature climbing from
uncomfortable toward warm, shadows twisting underfoot.</p>
<p>“—three seasons running we’ve hit quota, Empress, three seasons, and
this one the second herd got sick, we lost four animals, we gave what we
could without—”</p>
<p>“You gave what you decided to give,” Nyx said pleasantly.</p>
<p>“We gave what we had.”</p>
<p>“You have fruit trees.” Nyx nodded toward them. “I can see them from
here. I could see them from the road.”</p>
<p>Garrett’s jaw tightened. “The trees are for the children—”</p>
<p>“We had an agreement.”</p>
<p>“—we can’t give the children’s food to—”</p>
<p>“Then grow more.”</p>
<p>The words dropped into the conversation and the ripples went through
the crowd visibly — a collective flinch, a few exchanged glances. A
woman near the back, young, tired-faced, holding an infant, made a sound
that wasn’t quite a laugh.</p>
<p>Hellhound’s head turned toward her.</p>
<p>The woman caught it and looked away fast.</p>
<p>Then looked back. She couldn’t help it. Most of them couldn’t.</p>
<p>Hellhound had been standing slightly behind Nyx’s left shoulder since
they’d walked in, quiet, watching, and she’d clocked it — the moment the
crowd started noticing her properly. Not the empty shoulder first, as
she’d expected. They stared. At the eyes first. Always the eyes. The way
they caught the morning light wrong, too bright, the yellowish metallic
gleam of them sitting in a pale face, surrounded with dark circles,
tracking the crowd with the unhurried patience of something that was
very comfortable waiting.</p>
<p>A child near the front tugged her mother’s sleeve and pointed. The
mother had pulled the child’s hand down without looking away from
Hellhound.</p>
<p>Garrett was still talking. His voice had found a rawer gear
underneath the careful diplomacy.</p>
<p>“Empress, with respect — we don’t know what’s enough. Last season we
gave more than the season before and it still wasn’t—” He stopped
himself. “We’re trying. We are genuinely trying. But when the number
moves and we don’t know where it moved to until you’re standing at our
gate at dawn—”</p>
<p>“You’re saying my system is unclear.”</p>
<p>The trap closed. Garrett heard it. His mouth shut.</p>
<p>“I’m saying,” he said carefully, “that it would help us to serve you
better if we understood—”</p>
<p>“You understand exactly what’s required.” Nyx’s voice hadn’t changed.
Hadn’t heated, hadn’t sharpened. Just absolutely certain of itself. “You
provide for your settlement and you provide for mine. When you provide
well, I have no reason to visit. When you provide poorly—” She gestured
at the space between them, the dawn, the entire situation. “Here we
are.”</p>
<p>“But what <em>is</em> providing well—”</p>
<p>“Garrett.” Hellhound heard her own voice come out before she’d
decided to speak.</p>
<p>He looked at her. The crowd looked at her.</p>
<p>She stepped forward. Not far. Just enough.</p>
<p>“Two years,” she said. “You’ve been under Marauder protection for two
years. How many raids have hit Plainside in that time?”</p>
<p>Garrett blinked. “None, but—”</p>
<p>“Two years, no raids.” She tilted her head. “Twenty-two people. A
pregnant woman who gave birth. Children who are still alive. Elderly who
got to die in beds.” Her eyes moved over the crowd, unhurried,
cataloguing. “Fruit trees that are obviously harvested and obviously
healthy and obviously producing, which I can see from here.”</p>
<p>She let that land.</p>
<p>“You want to know what settlements your size look like outside
Marauder territory?” Her voice was pleasant. Conversational. “I know,
because I was among the ones who burned them. For less than this.” She
watched his face change. “For much less than this. For a bad look. For a
warlord who woke up in a mood. For sport, sometimes, just to keep the
crew busy.” She smiled, and it didn’t reach her eyes at all. “Those
people didn’t get a quota. They didn’t get a choice. They got us showing
up and taking everything and leaving with their livestock and whoever
was young enough to sell and whatever was left standing we torched
because why not.”</p>
<p>The crowd had gone very still.</p>
<p>“You should be on your knees,” Hellhound said, “that you get a
choice.”</p>
<p>“We ARE grateful—” Garrett started.</p>
<p>“Are you.” She tilted her head and looked at him the way she’d look
at a gauge reading wrong. “Because grateful people don’t send compost.”
She looked past him at the fruit trees again, then back. “You know what
I see when I look at this settlement?”</p>
<p>He didn’t answer.</p>
<p>“I see two years of peak conditions,” she said. “Protection. Safety.
Nobody touching your fields at night. Nobody touching your people. Two
full seasons to work, to grow, to build, to become more than you were
when you got here — and you’re standing in front of me talking about how
hard it’s been.” She laughed, short and sharp, the sound of something
genuinely offended. “A struggling settlement doesn’t survive two years.
A struggling settlement doesn’t keep twenty-two people fed and birth new
ones and grow fruit trees and maintain a second grazer herd. You didn’t
struggle. You thrived. And then you decided to keep the fruits of that
for yourselves and call it a hard season.”</p>
<p>“We have growing needs—” the young man from before said, voice
cracking.</p>
<p>“Growing needs.” She repeated it like she was tasting something
rotten. “Yes. That’s the problem exactly, isn’t it. Your needs grew.
Your comfort grew. Your idea of what you’re entitled to grew.” She
turned to look at him fully and he took a half step back before he
caught himself. “You had two perfect years and instead of using them to
become efficient — to build surplus, to expand yield, to make yourselves
genuinely irreplaceable — you used them to get comfortable. And
comfortable people start believing their personal needs are a line item
that comes before their obligations.” She shook her head, one sharp
disgusted movement. “You didn’t grow the settlement. You grew
yourselves. And now you want credit for your sorry ass excuses and she’s
supposed to adjust her expectations downward because you decided your
quality of life matters more than your function.”</p>
<p>“We’re people—”</p>
<p>“You’re <em>variables</em>,” Hellhound said. “You’re input. You go
in, the system runs, you receive what the system provides. The moment
you stop functioning as input—” She spread her missing right hand, the
empty socket shifting slightly with the movement. “You stop being part
of the system.”</p>
<p>Garrett’s eyes had dropped to the empty shoulder. Then back up to her
eyes. She watched him do the math — one arm, those wrong bright eyes,
not a Marauder, not anyone he recognized, standing here talking like she
owned the place — the confusion reorganizing into something that wanted
to be contempt and was too uncertain to commit.</p>
<p>“You’re—” He stopped.</p>
<p>“Go ahead.”</p>
<p>“You’ve got one arm.”</p>
<p>“I do.”</p>
<p>“You’re not even—” He looked at Nyx, then back. “What is she? What
are you bringing her here for, she’s—” He gestured at Hellhound’s
shoulder. The crowd had fully clocked it now, she could feel it moving
through them, the recalibration. <em>A cripple. She brought a one-armed
— what is this, why is she—</em></p>
<p>“You want to know what I would do,” Hellhound said, very quietly, “if
this was my call.”</p>
<p>The crowd went still.</p>
<p>Her eyes moved over them. All of them. Slow and thorough, the burn
order she’d been running since they walked in sitting right behind her
expression where anyone paying attention could see the shape of it.</p>
<p>“I’d tie you to your fence posts,” she said. “One by one. And I’d
start with the barn, because barns go up fast and the smoke carries, and
I’d want the ones waiting their turn to watch it and understand exactly
what was coming.” Her voice was almost gentle. “Then the crop fields,
because you should see two years of your work turn to ash before the
end. Then the fruit trees, because you thought those were yours.” She
tilted her head. “And then I’d work my way through the rest, and I’d let
you listen to each other, and I’d let your children watch so they’d
remember, if any of them got to keep going, what happens when you
confuse someone’s patience for your right to exist.”</p>
<p>The silence was total.</p>
<p>The woman with the infant had both arms around the baby now and
wasn’t looking at Hellhound at all. The young man’s face had gone the
specific gray of someone who’d just understood something.</p>
<p>Garrett was staring at her.</p>
<p>Hellhound looked back at him. Relaxed. Patient.</p>
<p>She wasn’t performing. That was the thing — she watched them realize
it one by one, the moment they understood that the terrifying part was
that she meant every syllable and wasn’t even angry saying it. Just
certain. Just correct, the way arithmetic was correct.</p>
<p>And behind her, Nyx hadn’t moved. Hadn’t intervened. Hadn’t made a
sound.</p>
<p>The settlers’ eyes kept moving between them — the Empress standing
easy with her sawed-off, almost bored, and this strange bright-eyed
one-armed <em>thing</em> that had just described burning them in front
of their children like she was recounting a recipe.</p>
<p>Hellhound could see it land. The realization of what Nyx actually was
in this equation. Not the threat. The mercy. The thing standing between
them and whatever Hellhound was.</p>
<p>She heard Nyx shift her weight behind her.</p>
<p>“Hellhound.”</p>
<p>She turned.</p>
<p>Nyx was looking at her with a half-lidded expression, one that didn’t
give anything away and was giving everything away simultaneously. One
second of it. Just one.</p>
<p>Then…</p>
<p>“Catch.”</p>
<p>She unclipped the arm from her belt and threw it.</p>
<p>Hellhound’s left hand snapped up and took it clean out of the
air.</p>
<p>She looked at it. The socket end. The hinge.</p>
<p>That’s not the same break.</p>
<p>She turned it. Looked closer. Clean weld, new pin, the socket ring
reseated, connector pins aligned and intact. Not a patch job. Real work.
Someone who understood the mechanism had taken it apart and rebuilt it
and—</p>
<p><em>She planned this.</em></p>
<p>Two seconds. Confusion — understanding — and then every circuit she
had lighting up at once, her whole system recognizing what had just been
communicated without a single word<em>, she knew she’d deploy me, she
repaired it because she knew, she looked at me last night and saw
something worth keeping functional—</em></p>
<p><em>I didn’t fail my part.</em></p>
<p>The click was clean and perfect.</p>
<p>Connector pins finding contacts. Pneumatics cycling, the familiar
hiss of pressure building through the system, pistons calibrating, the
battery reading low but functional, heating coils pulsing once in—</p>
<p>“Finally,” Hellhound snarled.</p>
<p>It came out raw and animal, something between a growl and a sob that
she didn’t try to swallow, her whole body shuddering with it as the arm
seated fully and the weight redistributed, her right side stopped
feeling like an open wound. Her left fist clenched hard against her
thigh. Her right hand opened and closed and opened and the pistons
hissed and she felt it, the pressure feedback through the neural link,
the sensation of her own fingers—</p>
<p>The injector fired with a hiss.</p>
<p>She hadn’t consciously triggered it. The arm cycling up, the neural
connection reestablishing, the system reading her state and making its
own decision — one measured unit of PYRA, delivered clean into her
bloodstream, and she shivered so hard her teeth clicked together.</p>
<p>The drug moved through her like a door opening. Sensory input
sharpening at the edges. The warmth of the morning becoming precise
instead of ambient. The sound of the settlers’ breathing separating into
individual rhythms. Her headache, which had been sitting behind her eyes
since dawn, became manageable, became background, the system filing it
away as non-critical.</p>
<p>Her eyes adjusted.</p>
<p>She could feel them doing it. The metallic quality of her irises
catching the light differently, the reflectivity shifting, the dawn sun
low and orange-red on the horizon painting everything in copper and
blood. She watched the settlers watching her pupils narrowing and she
didn’t look away, just let them see it, the yellowish glow of her eyes
deepening into something almost luminescent in the morning light,
catching the sun the way an animal’s eyes caught firelight.</p>
<p>The child near the front made a small frightened sound.</p>
<p>Hellhound’s heating coils engaged.</p>
<p>Not deliberately. Or not entirely deliberately — the neural link was
fresh, her system was running hot, her emotional state was doing what it
always did to the arm’s stability, and the coils responded to all of it
by climbing from dormant to active in about four seconds, with sparks
and crackling, her knuckles turning bright red.</p>
<p>She watched the settlers’ faces.</p>
<p>Watched the fear move through the crowd like weather.</p>
<p>Her head dropped slightly, chin toward her chest, and her eyes
tracked upward from under her brow — that narrow field of vision, that
particular angle that let her see everything without meeting anyone’s
eyes, without the commitment of direct contact. Head tilted sideways
now, using the limitation differently, scanning across the gathered
faces from an oblique angle. She found the man with the rifle. The young
man. The woman with the infant who had pressed herself back toward the
nearest building. The children clustered near the fence.</p>
<p>She filed them all.</p>
<p>Garrett had not moved. To his credit he had not moved, which meant he
had some instinct for self-preservation even in a state of obvious
terror. His eyes were fixed on the glowing knuckles.</p>
<p>Hellhound stepped toward him.</p>
<p>He stepped back.</p>
<p>She stopped.</p>
<p>Her head came up just slightly, still angled down, eyes still
scanning from that low oblique position. Her voice came out quiet and
almost friendly.</p>
<p>“If you run,” she said, “I torch the place. Starting with the
children.”</p>
<p>Nobody moved.</p>
<p>“Come here.”</p>
<p>Garrett’s throat worked. His hands were at his sides, very
deliberately at his sides, not near the rifle slung on his shoulder. He
looked at Nyx.</p>
<p>Nyx was watching Hellhound with her arms loosely crossed and her
weight on one hip and an expression that gave absolutely nothing
away.</p>
<p>Nobody was coming to help him.</p>
<p>He took one step forward. Then another, slow and careful, the walk of
a man approaching something he didn’t fully understand and understood
well enough to be terrified of.</p>
<p>Hellhound didn't wait for him to close the distance.</p>
<p>She crossed the last two steps fast, stopped just inside his
space—close enough that he had to tilt his head back slightly to keep
her in view—and raised her right hand. Not touching. Just there. Fingers
curled loose, palm facing him, the heating coils along her knuckles
glowing dull red in the dim light.</p>
<p>He went completely rigid.</p>
<p><em>Smart.</em></p>
<p>Hellhound's head tilted, examining him from that low angle, eyes
tracking up his face. His pulse was visible in his neck, rapid and
shallow, jumping under the skin. She could see the exact moment his
brain registered what those coils could do.</p>
<p>"The children," she said conversationally, "have very soft skin.
Perfect for branding."</p>
<p>Garrett said nothing. His breathing had gone ragged.</p>
<p>"You know how hot metal gets?" She watched his eyes. "You've worked
with metal. You're a practical man. You know what it does to skin." Her
fingers flexed slightly—just a small movement, not even towards him—and
he flinched so hard the rifle strap slipped off his shoulder. "Have you
ever smelled it? Burning flesh?" She tilted her head the other way.
"It's distinct. Very distinct. Once you know it you never mistake it for
anything else."</p>
<p>"No," Garrett whispered.</p>
<p>"No what."</p>
<p>"No—please, I haven't—please don't—"</p>
<p>Her hand closed around his throat.</p>
<p>The coils made contact instantly. Skin met red-hot metal and the
reaction was immediate—the wet hiss of moisture flash-boiling, the
specific high pitch of tissue beginning to char. Garrett's whole body
seized, every muscle locking at once, but Hellhound's grip was already
there, fingers wrapped firm, holding him in place.</p>
<p>Not crushing. Just keeping him exactly where she wanted him.</p>
<p>The smell hit the air within seconds. Sharp. Disgusting.</p>
<p>Garrett made a sound, something between a scream and a choke, his
mouth open, his eyes going glassy. His hands flew up on reflex, grabbing
at her wrist, but the prosthetic didn't budge. His palms slapped
uselessly against the metal plating, finding no purchase, no leverage,
nothing to pull.</p>
<p>Hellhound didn't move. Didn't tighten. Didn't let go.</p>
<p>She just held him there, coils pressed flush against his neck, the
heat doing exactly what heat did when given time and pressure. The skin
beneath her fingers was blistering now, the edges of the burn turning
black, the inside sticking to the coils.</p>
<p>Three seconds. Four.</p>
<p>The crowd behind him surged forward in a wave of horror that stopped
itself before it became anything actionable because Nyx was still
standing there, still watching, still not moving.</p>
<p>Hellhound let go. She jerked her hand away, ripping off the layer of
charred skin that fused with the coils.</p>
<p>Garrett staggered back, his hand flying to his neck. His knees
buckled but he didn't go down, he caught himself, gasping, his fingers
hovering over the burn, he didn’t dare touch it.</p>
<p>The mark was clean. Precise. A perfect outline of her knuckles
branded into his throat, the edges cauterized, the center still smoking
faintly.</p>
<p>Hellhound looked at it. Then at him. Then at the crowd.</p>
<p>Her head dropped back to that low angle. Eyes scanning them from
underneath. Her voice was almost playful.</p>
<p>"That," she said, "was an accident."</p>
<p>She let the word sit in the silence for three full seconds.</p>
<p>"The next one won't be."</p>
<p>The crowd held its breaths. The woman with the infant had her face
turned away, shoulders hunched over the baby. The young man had both
hands pressed over his mouth. The children near the fence were
completely silent.</p>
<p>Garrett was still standing. His eyes had found Hellhound again and
the contempt was gone, the frustration was gone, the exhausted defiance
was gone. What was left was something rawer and more honest.</p>
<p>Hellhound looked at the fruit trees over his shoulder.</p>
<p>Then back at him.</p>
<p>Nyx moved.</p>
<p>Not fast. Not with any urgency. Slowly. She crossed the space between
them with the same unhurried authority she brought to everything, and
she put her hand on Hellhound’s shoulder.</p>
<p>“Alright,” she said. Pleasantly. To Hellhound, to the settlers, to
the morning in general. “I think we’ve made our point.”</p>
<p>Hellhound went still.</p>
<p>She felt the hand on her shoulder and she stood down. She understood
very well what was happening. The coils dimmed. The pistons settled. Her
hand uncurled slowly at her side.</p>
<p>She stepped back. Once. And then she just — stopped. Stood. Became
furniture.</p>
<p>“There she is,” Nyx said softly, almost to herself, and there was
something in her voice that wasn’t for the settlers at all.</p>
<p>Then she turned to face the crowd and her expression went warm.
Friendly.</p>
<p>“I apologize for the early hour, I really do,” she said, like she
meant it. Like she was a neighbor who’d knocked too loud. “I know you’ve
all got work to do.”</p>
<p>Hellhound clocked the shift in tone. Understood it.</p>
<p>Nyx continued.</p>
<p>“I’m not here to ruin your morning more than I have to.” Nyx glanced
around the gathered crowd with that easy warmth and the convincing
half-smile. “I came because I was disappointed. And I think you
understand that now.” A small pause. “So. Tell me what you can do.”</p>
<p>A beat of silence.</p>
<p>Then someone spoke. Not Garrett — a woman, middle-aged, the kind of
face that had been doing hard practical work since before her wrinkles —
and her voice shook slightly. “We can — the fruit harvest is almost at
peak. We can bring you the full yield. All of it. Please take it.”</p>
<p>“That is very generous,” Nyx said warmly.</p>
<p>“And the flour—” another voice, from somewhere in the middle of the
crowd. “We can send double next month.”</p>
<p>“I appreciate that, I really do.”</p>
<p>They were falling over each other now. A young man stepped forward
with his hands clasped in front of him. “The grain shortage was — we can
make that up. Three months. We’ll run the fields double rotation, we can
deliver—”</p>
<p>“I don’t want you to overextend yourselves,” Nyx said, gently
interrupting, her voice sounded remarkably like it was full of
concern.</p>
<p>He stared at her.</p>
<p>“You have a settlement to maintain. Children to feed.” She smiled,
and it reached her eyes, and it was completely convincing. “Tell me
what’s realistic. I’d rather a promise you can keep than a number that
leaves you struggling again next season.”</p>
<p>The young man opened his mouth. Closed it. Looked at Garrett, who was
no longer useful to him. Looked back at Nyx.</p>
<p>“We can — three months of double grain,” he said. “Realistically. And
the full fruit yield now.”</p>
<p>“And the flour,” the woman added quickly.</p>
<p>“The flour,” he agreed. “And — we can butcher two more grazers. Full
animals this time. Nothing kept.”</p>
<p>Garrett looked at Nyx, then at Hellhound, then back.</p>
<p>Hellhound didn’t look at him. The heating coils had cooled to
dormant. The pistons were quiet.</p>
<p>She looked like something that had been switched off.</p>
<p>That was the part the settlers couldn’t look away from. The snarling,
the coils, the burn — that had been terrifying in a way they could
process, could file under violence, could build a response to. This was
different. This was the specific wrongness of a thing that had just
demonstrated exactly what it was capable of and was now standing at
rest, patient and completely without expression, watching them with
those too-bright eyes.</p>
<p>“See,” Nyx said, and her voice like she always believed in them, like
she never doubted them for a moment, and was simply pleased to have her
faith confirmed. “That’s all I needed to hear.”</p>
<p>More proposals came. Somebody mentioned the beets, a surplus they’d
been sitting on. Somebody else brought up a preserved fruit stock they’d
made in spring and hadn’t included in the last delivery, offered it
immediately, almost stumbling over the words. Each offer landed in Nyx’s
warmth and stayed there, accepted, appreciated, built upon.</p>
<p>Hellhound’s eyes moved to the fruit trees. Back to the crowd. To the
barn. Tasted the idea of what would have happened, if Nyx let her burn
the place down. How beautifully the wood, the crops, the trees would
have caught on flames. How the planks would have popped, crackled, how
the smoke would have turned the sky dark.</p>
<p>But Nyx was right. It was <em>inefficient.</em></p>
<p>A child near the fence had been staring at her for several minutes.
Just staring, with the wide fixed eyes. Like he had found something that
didn’t fit any category he had known.</p>
<p>Hellhound’s eyes drifted to the child.</p>
<p>The child stared back.</p>
<p>Hellhound looked away first. Back to the crowd. Back to the
monitoring.</p>
<p>“—and we truly are sorry, Empress,” Garrett was saying, his voice
finding something steadier now that the proposals had built a structure
around him, something to stand inside. “It won’t happen again. We
understand now. We do.”</p>
<p>“I know you do,” Nyx said with a friendly smile, and she sounded like
she meant it, like she was genuinely moved by his sincerity. Like this
whole morning had been a minor misunderstanding between reasonable
people that had been resolved to everyone’s satisfaction. “That’s all I
wanted.” She glanced around the crowd one more time, warm and unhurried.
“You’re good people. You work hard. I want Plainside to thrive.” She
said it simply, without irony, without any visible edge.</p>
<p>She meant all of it and none of it and both of those things were
equally true and the settlers would go home and tell each other she’d
been fair. They’d been heard. They’d worked it out.</p>
<p>They’d remember the burn. They’d remember the eyes. And they’d tell
each other that Nyx had been fair. She kept them safe. Gave them
mercy.</p>
<p>“Send the fruit yield by end of week,” Nyx said. “The rest on the
schedule you proposed.” She nodded to Garrett. “Take care of that
neck.”</p>
<p>She turned and walked back toward the gate without looking back. She
never doubted the outcome.</p>
<p>Hellhound followed.</p>
<p>She didn’t look at the settlers as she passed them. Didn’t
acknowledge the space they made, the way the crowd parted before she
reached them, giving her a wider berth than necessary. She just walked,
head still angled slightly down, eyes forward now.</p>
<p>At the gate Nyx paused and glanced back at the settlement. At the
fruit trees. At the crowd still standing in the open space watching them
leave.</p>
<p>“Good proposals,” she said, to nobody in particular.</p>
<p>Hellhound said nothing.</p>
<p>They walked back to the bikes in silence, Nyx leading the way.
Hellhound watched the farmers say their sweetest goodbyes and best
wishes, but it none of those words were honest.</p>
<p>The Empress knew too, but why would she care. As long as they pay. As
long as they respect her.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The bikes sat side by side in the dust, Nyx’s monstrosity with its
mounted gun catching the morning sun, Hellhound’s smaller frame leaning
on its kickstand looking almost apologetic next to it. The settlement
was behind them now, far enough that voices wouldn’t carry but close
enough that anyone looking could still see them as silhouettes against
the desert.</p>
<p>Hellhound reached for her bike’s handlebar.</p>
<p>“Hold on.”</p>
<p>She stopped. Turned.</p>
<p>Nyx was standing with her weight on one hip, hand out, palm up.
Casual. Expectant.</p>
<p>“Arm.”</p>
<p>Hellhound’s whole body went still. Froze.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“The arm.” Nyx gestured with her open hand, a small come-here motion.
“Give it back.”</p>
<p>“You just—” Hellhound’s jaw worked. “You just gave it to me.”</p>
<p>“I loaned it to you,” Nyx said pleasantly. “For the job. Job’s
done.”</p>
<p>“I need this—”</p>
<p>“I know.” The two words landed.</p>
<p>Hellhound stared at her. Her right hand had started that
micro-trembling again, pistons adjusting to movements she wasn’t
consciously making.</p>
<p>Nyx waited. Patient. Her hand still out.</p>
<p>“It’s not safe to keep detaching it,” Hellhound said finally, voice
tight. “The junction gets damaged, the connectors—”</p>
<p>“The junction is fine. I had it rebuilt.” Nyx’s tone was still
pleasant. Still warm. “Clean weld. New pins. Better than it was before,
actually.” A pause. “So that excuse doesn’t work.”</p>
<p>Hellhound’s throat worked. Her left hand had found her thigh, nails
digging in.</p>
<p>“You don’t understand,” she tried again. “Without the arm I can’t
regulate doses properly, I can’t defend myself, I can’t—”</p>
<p>“You’re right,” Nyx interrupted, her voice shifting just slightly,
the warmth cooling by a degree. “Without that arm you’re a cripple.
One-handed, vulnerable, and meat for anyone who wants you.” She tilted
her head. “Which is exactly my point.”</p>
<p>Hellhound said nothing. Her breathing had gone shallow.</p>
<p>“Last night,” Nyx said conversationally, “you set my camp on
fire.”</p>
<p>“I was fighting—”</p>
<p>“I don’t care who you were fighting.” Nyx’s hand dropped to her side.
She took a step closer. “One of my people came to me, said there was a
fight near the firepit, newcomer versus one of the resurgents who
freelances through here. Fine. Fights happen. I sent guards to handle
it.”</p>
<p>Another step.</p>
<p>“By the time I got there, you’d turned the whole area into a fucking
bonfire. Benches burning. Shipping container with a hole punched through
it. Sparks everywhere. My guards trying to put it out before it spread
to the storage shacks.” She stopped a few feet away. “And you, standing
in the middle of it all, coils glowing, looking like you were having the
time of your life.”</p>
<p>“I wasn’t—”</p>
<p>“You were playing,” Nyx said, simply. “High as fuck on two shots of
PYRA, fighting a resurgent you could’ve killed in thirty seconds, and
instead you’re making art projects out of my furniture.”</p>
<p>Hellhound’s jaw clenched. “The fire helped me focus—”</p>
<p>“I don’t give a shit what it helped you do.” Nyx’s voice hadn’t
risen. Hadn’t sharpened. Just absolutely certain. “You were a guest. An
outsider. And you decided my camp was your personal playground.”</p>
<p>She let that sit.</p>
<p>“Then,” she continued, “I arrive. I tell my guards to stand down. And
what do you do?”</p>
<p>Hellhound said nothing. Her nails were definitely breaking skin
now.</p>
<p>“You kill one of them,” Nyx finished. “Right in front of me. While
I’m walking toward you. While I’m ordering you to me.” She tilted her
head. “He wasn’t a threat anymore. None of them were. They were standing
down and I made that crystal clear. But you crushed his throat anyway
because I called you a dog and you didn’t like it.”</p>
<p>“I was still—” Hellhound stopped. Started again. “The PYRA was still
active, I wasn’t thinking clearly—”</p>
<p>“Exactly.” Nyx’s smile was cold. “You weren’t thinking. You were high
and stupid and angry, and you killed one of my guards because your
feelings got hurt.”</p>
<p>The silence stretched. Hellhound was staring at the ground now, her
whole body tense.</p>
<p>“Do you know what that looks like to my people?” Nyx asked, quieter
now. “The ones who saw it?”</p>
<p>Hellhound’s head came up slightly.</p>
<p>“It looks like I’m playing favorites,” Nyx said. “Like some junkie
newcomer gets to kill guards and set fires and I just… let it happen.
Like I’ll protect her over my own men.” She crossed her arms. “It looks
like I can’t control my own dog.”</p>
<p>Hellhound flinched.</p>
<p>“So now I have guards wondering if they’re expendable,” Nyx
continued. “Wondering if this crippled stray matters more to me than
they do. Wondering what the fuck I see in you that’s worth a man’s
life.” She paused. “And I have to fix that. Because the moment my guards
stop trusting my judgment is the moment I lose them.”</p>
<p>Hellhound’s right hand was shaking badly now. The pistons were
whining.</p>
<p>“So.” Nyx’s hand came back out. “Arm.”</p>
<p>“If you take it I can’t—” Hellhound’s voice cracked. “I can’t
function. I can’t build reputation, I can’t defend myself, I—” She
stopped. Forced it out. “It’s the only thing that separates me being a
weapon from just being a cripple and—”</p>
<p>“I know.” Nyx’s voice had gentled slightly. “Which is why I’m not
taking it permanently. I’m just making sure you understand something
first.”</p>
<p>Hellhound looked up.</p>
<p>“You’re nothing without me,” Nyx said simply. “Not here. You walk
around with that arm thinking you’re someone, thinking you’re a player,
but you’re not.” She gestured around them, at the desert, the settlement
behind them, the empty road ahead. “Without me deciding you matter,
you’re just another body the wasteland chews up.”</p>
<p>She let that land.</p>
<p>“So,” she said again. “Arm.”</p>
<p>Hellhound’s hand moved to the socket. Her fingers found the release
mechanism. They hovered there for three full seconds.</p>
<p>Then she clicked it.</p>
<p>The arm detached with a hiss of venting pressure. Hellhound caught it
against her chest with her left hand, stared down at it. With grief.</p>
<p>Then she held it out.</p>
<p>Nyx took it. Inspected it briefly — connector pins, socket joint,
battery level — then clipped it to her belt.</p>
<p>“Good girl.”</p>
<p>The words were quiet. Almost fond.</p>
<p>Hellhound’s jaw worked. Her left hand had curled into a fist against
her thigh.</p>
<p>Nyx turned, walked a few paces toward her bike, then stopped and
leaned against it. Arms crossed. Patient.</p>
<p>“Now,” she said. “Let’s talk about what you actually are.”</p>
<p>Hellhound didn’t move. Didn’t speak.</p>
<p>“Your eyes are weird,” Nyx said conversationally. “I noticed that
first. Too bright. Metallic. They catch light wrong.” She tilted her
head. “And they don’t fade. Most junkies, their eyes go dull between
doses. Especially with PYRA — that shit burns you out, makes you look
half-dead when you’re not actively high.” A pause. “Yours don’t. They’ve
been bright since you walked through my gates.”</p>
<p>Hellhound’s throat worked.</p>
<p>“Then there’s the cage fight,” Nyx continued. “I pumped CN-47 into
that arena. Slaves went feral in under a minute.” She watched
Hellhound’s face. “You didn’t. You looked annoyed. Almost bored.”</p>
<p>“I have a tolerance—”</p>
<p>“Tolerance doesn’t explain immunity,” Nyx cut in. “You weren’t just
stable. You looked comfortable. Like the gas was doing exactly what you
wanted it to.”</p>
<p>Hellhound said nothing.</p>
<p>“And last night,” Nyx said, “you took two shots of PYRA. Which
should’ve either killed you or turned you into a mindless aggro mess.”
She pushed off the bike, took a step closer. “But you didn’t lose
yourself. You got sharper. Faster. More focused. Even when you killed my
guard you weren’t feral — you were precise. Angry, sure, but controlled.
You could talk, you could think, you could hear me and listen. Well, if
we can call it that.”</p>
<p>She stopped a few feet away.</p>
<p>“So here’s what I think,” she said quietly. “You’re either the
luckiest junkie alive, or you’re turning aberrant and you’re just really
good at hiding it.”</p>
<p>Hellhound’s head snapped up. “I’m not turning.”</p>
<p>“How do you know?”</p>
<p>“Because I’ve been dosing for three years and I’m still here.”</p>
<p>The number hung in the air between them.</p>
<p>Nyx’s eyebrows went up slightly. “Three years. On PYRA.”</p>
<p>“Daily.”</p>
<p>“Jesus.” Nyx said it softly. Then her eyes sharpened. “Show me your
arm.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Your arm. The one you still have.” Nyx gestured. “Track marks. If
you’ve been shooting PYRA daily for three years your veins should be
collapsed.”</p>
<p>Hellhound hesitated, then held out her left arm.</p>
<p>Nyx grabbed her wrist. Turned it over. Inspected the inside of the
elbow, the forearm, the veins running visible under pale skin.</p>
<p>Clean. A few scars from other things, but no track marks. No
bruising. No visible damage.</p>
<p>Nyx let go. Stepped back.</p>
<p>“You heal fast,” she said. “Or you don’t damage the same way.”</p>
<p>Hellhound pulled her arm back, rubbed her wrist.</p>
<p>“So,” Nyx said. “What are you?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know.”</p>
<p>“Try again.”</p>
<p>Hellhound’s jaw clenched. Her left hand was doing that wrist-bending
thing again, pressing it back, holding it, releasing it.</p>
<p><em>Can’t tell everything.</em></p>
<p>“I realized a while ago that drugs affect me differently,” she said
finally. “Overdosing doesn’t kill me. Some drugs do nothing at all. Some
make me sharper, some give me energy, some strip my filters.” She looked
up. “I don’t know why. I just know I’m different.”</p>
<p>“Different how?”</p>
<p>“I need baseline doses or I shut down,” Hellhound said. “Withdrawal
hits hard. Symptoms get bad. If I don’t dose regularly I’ll die.” She
paused. “But I don’t turn. I don’t crave—” She stopped. Couldn’t say it.
“I don’t go feral. I don’t lose myself.”</p>
<p>Nyx was quiet for a moment, watching her.</p>
<p>“An anomaly,” she said finally.</p>
<p>Hellhound said nothing.</p>
<p>“Something in your genetics got fucked up somewhere,” Nyx continued,
almost to herself. “Drug exposure, radiation, chemical runoff, who
knows. Your body processes this shit differently.” She tilted her head.
“Which makes you either extremely useful or extremely dangerous.”</p>
<p>“I’m not dangerous—”</p>
<p>“You killed my guard,” Nyx reminded her, pleasantly. “While high.
Because you were angry.”</p>
<p>Hellhound’s jaw worked. “I can control it—”</p>
<p>“Can you?” Nyx’s eyes hadn’t left hers. “Because from where I’m
standing, you look like a junkie with a chemical dependency, abnormal
drug tolerance, and a history of violent outbursts and rage fits when
you’re dosed.” She let that sit. “That’s textbook early-stage
aberration, Hellhound. The only difference is your eyes are still
bright.”</p>
<p>“I’m not turning,” Hellhound said, too loud, too fast. “I would
know—”</p>
<p>“Would you?” Nyx took another step closer. “Or are you just telling
yourself that because the alternative is admitting you’re already
gone?”</p>
<p>Hellhound’s breathing had gone ragged. Her left hand was clenched so
hard against her thigh she could feel bone.</p>
<p>“I <em>need</em> the arm,” she said, voice wrecked. “Without it I
can’t manage doses properly. I can’t function. I’ll—” She stopped.
Swallowed. “I’ll die. Either from withdrawal or from not being able to
defend myself long enough to get the next dose.”</p>
<p>Nyx watched her for a long moment.</p>
<p>Then she unclipped the arm from her belt.</p>
<p>Hellhound’s eyes tracked it like a starving animal tracking food.</p>
<p>“Here’s what’s going to happen,” Nyx said, holding the arm between
them. “I’m going to give this back to you. And then I’m going to tell
you exactly what you are and what you’re going to do for me.”</p>
<p>Hellhound nodded once. Desperate. Too honest.</p>
<p>“But first,” Nyx said, “I need you to understand something.”</p>
<p>She didn’t hand the arm over. Just held it. Waited.</p>
<p>Hellhound’s throat worked.</p>
<p>“You are nothing without me,” Nyx said quietly. “Not here. Not in my
territory. You don’t get to build a reputation on your own. You don’t
get to be someone because you decided you are.” She tilted her head.
“You’re someone when I say you are. When I point you at a problem and
let you solve it. The rest of the time you’re a liability I’m
managing.”</p>
<p>She let that sit.</p>
<p>“Last night you made me look weak,” she continued. “You forced me to
choose between killing you and letting my guards think I play
favorites.” She paused. “I chose wrong. I should’ve put you down
immediately.”</p>
<p>Hellhound flinched.</p>
<p>“But I didn’t,” Nyx said, “because I saw something useful. Something
I could deploy.” Her eyes moved over Hellhound — the missing arm, the
too-bright eyes, the desperate tension in every line of her body. “So
here’s the deal.”</p>
<p>She held the arm out slightly. Presenting it.</p>
<p>“I don’t want you at the center of my empire,” she said. “You’re too
volatile. Too unpredictable. I can’t have you near my throne setting
fires and killing guards every time you get pissed off.” She paused.
“But I also want to keep you. I don’t want you under one of my warlords.
Because you’re my toy. And I don’t share.”</p>
<p>Hellhound’s eyes hadn’t left the arm.</p>
<p>“So you get your own territory,” Nyx said. “Edge of Marauder land.
Your own crew. Your own space to be as feral as you want.”</p>
<p>Hellhound’s head came up slowly. Confusion flickering across her
face.</p>
<p>“You’ll enforce my rules,” Nyx continued. “Under my name. Fly my
colors, follow my laws, answer my orders.” Her voice was pleasant again.
Warm. “You get to build whatever you want inside your borders. Your
crew, your hierarchy, your mess. But you do it as a Marauder. Under my
banner. And if you fuck it up—”</p>
<p>She smiled.</p>
<p>“I’ll level your whole territory before you even know I’m
coming.”</p>
<p>The silence stretched.</p>
<p>Hellhound was staring at her now, eyes wide, something that looked
like hope trying to surface under the desperation.</p>
<p>“There are conditions,” Nyx said.</p>
<p>Hellhound nodded. Once. Sharp.</p>
<p>“First: you’re on the edge. That means it takes nothing for me to
wipe you out. You’re disposable if things go wrong. Expendable. A buffer
between me and whatever’s out there.” She watched Hellhound’s face. “You
fail, you die, I don’t lose anything important.”</p>
<p>“Understood.”</p>
<p>“Second: I’m not assigning you a crew.” Nyx lowered the arm slightly.
“You recruit. You build your own power from scratch. If the Marauders
don’t want to follow a one-armed junkie who sets camps on fire, that’s
your problem. If you can win people over—” She shrugged. “Good for them.
They know what they’re signing up for.”</p>
<p>Hellhound’s jaw worked. But she nodded again.</p>
<p>“Third,” Nyx said, voice dropping, “you are my dog. My pet. My
property. That doesn’t change. Ever.” She took a step closer. “You can
build power, gather followers, carve out a name for yourself — but you
do it on my leash. And the moment you forget that—”</p>
<p>She held the arm up between them.</p>
<p>“I’ll remind you.”</p>
<p>Hellhound’s breathing had gone shallow again. But her eyes were
tracking now, calculating, her internal judge running the numbers and
coming back with the same answer every time.</p>
<p><em>This is the best deal you will ever get.</em></p>
<p>“Do we have an understanding?” Nyx asked.</p>
<p>Hellhound’s throat worked.</p>
<p>“Yes,” she said.</p>
<p>Nyx smiled. Held the arm out properly now.</p>
<p>Hellhound took it with her left hand, fumbled it against her chest,
lined up the socket with shaking fingers. The connectors clicked home.
The pistons cycled. The battery hummed low but functional. The neural
link reestablished and her whole system seemed to exhale, the wrongness
of being incomplete suddenly gone.</p>
<p>She flexed her right hand. The fingers responded. The coils were
dormant but ready.</p>
<p>She looked up at Nyx.</p>
<p>Nyx was already walking back to her bike.</p>
<p>“Get on,” she said over her shoulder. “We’ve got a long ride back and
I want to make it before the heat gets stupid.”</p>
<p>She swung onto her bike, settled her weight, started the engine. The
rumble cut through the morning air.</p>
<p>Hellhound stood there for a moment, staring at her own right hand.
Flexing the fingers. Feeling the pistons adjust.</p>
<p>Then she turned to her bike and got on.</p>
<p>The road stretched ahead of them, empty and sun-bleached. Nyx pulled
out first, the dust cloud building behind her.</p>
<p>Hellhound opened the throttle and followed.</p>
<p>Her right hand on the handlebar felt solid. Real. The injector was
half-full. The battery was low but functional. She had spare batteries,
considering those, she had maybe three weeks before she needed to find a
generator, more if she rationed the heating coils.</p>
<p>But she had the arm.</p>
<p>She had a <em>territory.</em></p>
<p>She had a leash, sure — but it was a long one.</p>
<p>She grinned and squeezed her eyes shut.</p>
<p>For the first time since leaving the Rats, she had something that
felt like a system she could actually function inside.</p>
<p>Her judge was quiet.</p>
<p>Still.</p>
<p>Waiting to see if this would hold.</p>
<p>She gunned the engine, closed the gap. The desert swallowed them
both.</p>
