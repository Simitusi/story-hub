CHAOS: CHAPTER II – DROUGHTBREAK</h1>
<p>“Get out.” Nyx’s voice echoed in the church hall. The muttering
slaves suddenly fell silent.</p>
<p>Hellhound tried to gather herself quickly, but it was difficult with
only one arm. She drew her shoulder forward, checking the damage to the
junction. The interface itself didn’t seem to be damaged; only the
socket that kept her arm anchored had failed.</p>
<p>She glanced at Nyx. She was walking away. Time felt like it both
stalled and sped up.</p>
<p><em>Can’t let her walk away.<br />
What if she doesn’t know that I’m—<br />
No, I can’t, I have to…</em></p>
<p>She shook her head quickly.</p>
<p><em>No that’s not it, I can’t let her know how much I need that arm.
But fuck, what if she thinks it’s just a toy, it’s not a toy, I NEED IT,
I fucking need it, what if she doesn’t know I’m gonna die from this,
what if she just thinks she took my toy, what if she thinks this is just
a little game what if–</em></p>
<p>She shook her head again. Her breathing quickened, her throat
tightened and her eyes burned.</p>
<p>She punched herself in the jaw.</p>
<p>Then shook her head again.</p>
<p>Took a deep breath.</p>
<p>Stood up, forced a quick huff through her nose and walked out of the
church hall.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Walking felt wrong. Her balance felt wrong. Her right side suddenly
felt too light. She had to compensate not to eat dirt. Turns out the arm
was the difference between Hellhound <em>and a cripple.</em></p>
<p>She grunted as she pushed the church door open with her side.</p>
<p>That was when she realized something.</p>
<p>The darkness bleeding in from the outside stopped feeling
comforting.</p>
<p>Her safeguard. Her damn fucking circuit breaker.</p>
<p>The one thing that meant there was always a next move. Strength,
agility, regulation, all of it a flick of her wrist away.</p>
<p>Her system had always been designed with the worst case scenario in
mind. One failsafe. One margin that kept her above water no matter how
bad it got.</p>
<p>And now it was gone. Taken. Somewhere. No idea when or <em>if</em>
she’d get it back.</p>
<p>And now she felt like a bleeding prey in the middle of the ocean full
of predators. She knew they’d caught her scent, but where were they
hiding? Watching her from the shadows, waiting for her to leave the
light of the Empress’s church, so they can finally lunge and take her
apart.</p>
<p>Her judge kept telling her she deserved this. Even if she dies, even
if Skull hunts her down, she deserves it. Because she provoked, took
things for granted, thought this wouldn’t catch up to her. And now the
bill was finally arriving, slow but certain. She failed to see this
because her arrogance made her blind, made her think she’s above it ALL,
BECAUSE SHE HAD HER DRUGS, SHE HAD HER ARM, HER FIRE, EXCEPT THIS WAS
NOT HER STUPID PLAYGROUND TO BURN, AND SHE FORGOT WHY SHE WAS THERE IN
THE FIRST PLACE.</p>
<p><em>To prove her competence.</em></p>
<p>But once again, she managed to prove her volatility. How much of a
liability she was.</p>
<p>She started walking. The last drops of Pyra in her blood still gave
her some edge in the darkness, her focus was everywhere, monitoring
movements, shadows, flickers, sounds.</p>
<p>She couldn’t afford to overthink this anymore. Even though her rented
room wasn’t far from there, the distance felt endless. She felt too
exposed, defenseless.</p>
<p>Light.<br />
Footsteps.<br />
Dirt barely crunching.</p>
<p>And no bones rattling.</p>
<p>Hellhound’s whole body locked up.</p>
<p>She forced herself to breathe. The one approaching her was
hesitating. Careful. Giving her options. That meant she was still
alive.</p>
<p>She turned. Too late. The shape was closer than she’d expected. The
footsteps didn’t stop, moving toward her casually.</p>
<p>Too casual. Not predatory.</p>
<p>Which scared Hellhound more.</p>
<p>The scattered light from shacks and windows finally revealed the
figure: a lean woman. Nothing like the Marauders.</p>
<p>A settler? No. Why would a settler be here at night. A trader, maybe.
Someone’s fancy slave. That made more sense.</p>
<p>Or someone’s…entertainment for the night.</p>
<p>She swallowed.</p>
<p>How low was the bar, trying to pick up a cripple limping through the
dark?</p>
<p>She had a gun. Not raised. Not aiming at Hellhound.</p>
<p><em>Why would—</em></p>
<p>The woman snorted a laugh.</p>
<p>“You look like it’s not just your arm that decided to go on a
vacation, Hellhound.”</p>
<p>“Who the hell—”</p>
<p>“Mmm, does it really matter?” The woman circled her with long,
playful strides. “But call me Blink if you must.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, sure. I don’t have time for this, so let me just—”</p>
<p>Shots fired, dirt exploded right between Hellhound’s feet. Hellhound
jumped.</p>
<p>“Jesus, woman, what the fuck?”</p>
<p>“Oops. My hands are just <em>very</em> twitchy.”</p>
<p>Blink stepped closer to Hellhound, tilting her head as a smug smirk
crept up her face.</p>
<p>“Poor stray, crippled puppy,” Blink stepped into Hellhound’s space,
hands brushing her right shoulder. “I might be able to help you out,”
her voice dropped. “If you behave.”</p>
<p>Hellhound stepped back. Shook her head. Tried to gather her
thoughts.<br />
Her thoughts never showed up.</p>
<p>“I don’t need help, I’m—”</p>
<p>“Oh really? Might be my memory failing me, but isn’t there a bad
little cannibal looking for you?”</p>
<p>Hellhound swallowed, then frowned. Blink’s smile grew wider.</p>
<p>Hellhound rolled her eyes. “I’ve already taken care of that
problem.”</p>
<p><em>She did not.</em></p>
<p>Blink shrugged. “Well, whatever then,” she turned to leave. She
reached into her pockets, then pulled out a few syringes filled with
thick red liquid. “Then I will just find a better place for these.”</p>
<p>Hellhound’s head snapped up.</p>
<p>PYRA.</p>
<p>Those few shots could keep her functioning a bit longer.<br />
<em>Don’t show desperation. Can’t announce weakness.</em></p>
<p>“Wait.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Blink stopped, then gracefully turned on her heels to face Hellhound
again, gun pressed flat against her lower back as she leaned forward
onto her toes.</p>
<p>“What do you want for those?” Hellhound rasped.</p>
<p>“Do you have sweets?”</p>
<p><em>The what now.</em></p>
<p>Hellhound blinked.</p>
<p>“I can just give some random drugs—”</p>
<p>Blink dropped one of the syringes. It hit the ground and rolled. She
stepped on it, glass snapping under her boot as the liquid bled into the
dirt.</p>
<p>“Hmm, I should really get my hands checked.”</p>
<p>Hellhound’s eye twitched but she quickly reached into her pocket. She
managed to fish out three half melted bonbons, and tossed them to Blink.
Blink caught them all without much effort, and looked awfully delighted
about her newly acquired treasure.</p>
<p>“Come.”</p>
<p>Hellhound groaned, but followed her.</p>
<p><em>I guess she will give me the drugs later.<br />
Or was she joking?<br />
Aghh, if I ask again, she might break another one.<br />
What is she even doing, escorting me?</em></p>
<p>They were heading towards the guest quarters, towards Hellhound’s
room. The silence around them felt wrong. This was far from what
Hellhound predicted.<br />
She thought the moment she set foot in the darkness, she would get
attacked. Even with Blink escorting her, the situation didn’t feel much
safer. But somehow it worked.</p>
<p><em>Maybe Skull wouldn’t attack her with company?<br />
Makes sense, after all, Nyx’s guards held him at gunpoint too.<br />
He hunted only when he could avoid leaving a trace.<br />
Which raised another question.</em></p>
<p>“Why are you even escorting me?”</p>
<p>“Because you’re funny. Now you can be funny for longer.”</p>
<p>Hellhound blinked. Twice. Her eye twitched again.</p>
<p>“Excuse me?”</p>
<p>“What.”</p>
<p>At the gates Blink shoved the remaining syringes into Hellhound’s
chest. Hellhound barely managed to catch them with her one intact arm,
fumbling.</p>
<p>“How did you—”</p>
<p>“Hmm, now you DO have time for this, Hellhound?” Blink’s grin
widened. “Let’s just say I was bored.”</p>
<p>“Bored.”</p>
<p>“Very.” Blink yawned, stretched. “Night shift is a real drag.”<br />
She turned, waved without looking back. “Don’t die. I don’t like losing
my sweets supply.”</p>
<p>She was already gone.</p>
<p>Hellhound exhaled through her nose. She glanced down at the syringes
and frowned. Then turned and entered the guest quarters.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>She flopped into her bed and groaned into the mattress.</p>
<p><em>Shouldn’t have left this damn room.</em></p>
<p>Turning her head, she glanced at the syringes she set on the bedside
cabinet.</p>
<p><em>Two doses should give enough time. Just have to keep it
controlled.<br />
Tomorrow is another day.</em></p>
<p>She sat up and crossed her legs, digging into her pockets and dumping
everything onto the bed. Plastic ampules, powder packets, pills piling
together.</p>
<p>Rubbing her face with one hand, she sighed.</p>
<p><em>I have no clue what these idiots even value. Rats loved AX,
doesn’t mean it will work here. They have these…marks or whatever. Marks
over pills huh. Whatever.</em></p>
<p>Head shake. Her nails dug into her thigh.</p>
<p><em>Even if these are worth close to nothing here, worst case, I
could still get some PYRA for these. Well if they have PYRA. Fucking…
fuck me why are you built so damn picky…</em></p>
<p>She swept the drugs aside, exhaled hard, and walked to the
bathroom.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the room had water. Wouldn’t try drinking from it
though. Or getting it in the eyes.<br />
The thought made her shiver – had to shake her hands off… well,
<em>one</em> hand. Her other shoulder jerked too, out of habit. Her body
still believed she had her other arm.</p>
<p>Looking into the mirror, she turned so she could inspect the junction
properly now.</p>
<p><em>Nerve endings still sealed up. That’s good. Socket hinge is
broken but it’s an easy repair. Connector pins seem intact too.<br />
Ahhh, fuck you Nyx, you did such a clean job.<br />
Just…</em></p>
<p>Her breathing got faster. She huffed through her nose as her throat
tightened, panic growing in her stomach again.</p>
<p><em>Just please don’t fuck up that arm. Please.</em></p>
<p>She took a deep, slow breath, kept it in, and exhaled slowly. Then
looked at her own face in the cracked mirror.</p>
<p><em>You look so broken, pull it together.</em></p>
<p>Leaning closer, she pulled the skin of her cheek down to inspect her
own eye.</p>
<p><em>Lookin’ fine. Everything’s fine.</em></p>
<p>She cranked the tap, splashed some water onto herself.</p>
<p><em>Don’t want to bother with a full bath. So tired already.<br />
But…<br />
What if I won’t get access to water later? Could be days before I get
another chance.<br />
Long trip before meant no water for—<br />
No, stop, you’re spiraling, just pick—<br />
But I wanna sleeeeep.<br />
If I get in, I ain’t getting out for hours.<br />
Except what if Nyx wants me tomorrow and I’m filthy and she decides I’m
not worth—</em></p>
<p><em>STOOOP.</em></p>
<p>She finally let the water run and hunched over the tub with a
defeated groan.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The bath had taken hours. Sleep, when it came, lasted three. Pounding
on the door jolted her awake, before the sun even broke.</p>
<p>“Rise and shine, dog, Empress be calling ya!”</p>
<p>Hellhound scowled into her mattress, curling up on herself to shield
herself from the noise.</p>
<p>A loud bang made the door let out a pathetic crack.</p>
<p>“Fucking SAY something!”</p>
<p>Another kick.</p>
<p>“Jeez, I hear you, I hear you,” Hellhound groaned. “What’d that door
ever do to you.”</p>
<p>“Get your ass UP. Nyx don’t like waiting.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, yeah, give me a fucking minute—”</p>
<p>“You got thirty seconds before I kick this thing off its hinges.”</p>
<p>Hellhound growled into her pillow, then shoved herself upright.</p>
<p>Or tried to.</p>
<p>Her left arm pushed down into the mattress. Her right arm pushed down
into nothing.</p>
<p>She face-planted.</p>
<p>Her nose hit the sheets hard enough to make her eyes water. For a
second, she just laid there, completely still, processing what her body
had just done.</p>
<p>Then a sound bubbled up from her chest. A wheeze. Then a snort.</p>
<p>Then full, unhinged laughter.</p>
<p>She rolled onto her back, clutching her stomach with her one working
hand, cackling at the ceiling like an absolute maniac. Her shoulder—the
empty one—jerked with the motion, phantom limb still trying to
participate.</p>
<p><em>I forgot. I fucking FORGOT I don’t have an arm. What the fuck.
What the FUCK.</em></p>
<p>The laughter turned breathless, tears leaking from the corners of her
eyes. Her brain couldn’t process the absurdity anymore and just gave
up.</p>
<p>“You fucking high?!”</p>
<p>That made her laugh harder.</p>
<p>“Yeah, no, I mean,” she wheezed. “I’m—” She sucked in air, trying to
get words out. “I’m fine, just—” Another snort escaped. “Just
tripped.”</p>
<p>“The fuck are you tripping on, it’s been ten seconds—”</p>
<p>“Nothing, I’m fine!” She was still laughing. “Just—fuck, I’m getting
up, hold on—”</p>
<p>Silence from the other side of the door.</p>
<p>“…You hit your head or something?”</p>
<p>“Probably!” She was still giggling, wiping her eyes with the back of
her hand. “Fuck, okay. Okay, I’m getting up. For real.”</p>
<p>She rolled onto her side, then used her left arm— her only arm, —to
push herself into a sitting position. Slower this time. Compensating for
the weight imbalance.</p>
<p>There we go. Like a functional person. <em>Sort of.</em></p>
<p><em>Boots. Fuck. How…</em></p>
<p>She slipped her feet into them, fell back onto the bed and raised her
legs above her head. Gravity did the rest as the laces hung right above
her mouth. She caught them with her teeth, pulled and tied it with her
intact hand.</p>
<p>She stumbled to the cabinet, grabbed one of Blink’s syringes, and
stared at it.</p>
<p><em>Manual injection. Great. Love this for me.</em></p>
<p>She uncapped the syringe with her teeth, pressed the needle against
her thigh, hunting for the right angle. Her hand shook. But not from
withdrawal, not yet at least. Just exhaustion. Three hours of sleep and
a missing arm would do that.</p>
<p>She pressed the needle against her forearm, hunting for the right
angle.</p>
<p><em>Wait. Fuck.</em></p>
<p>Can’t stabilize the arm and inject it at the same time. Not
one-handed.</p>
<p>She pulled back, scowling at the syringe.</p>
<p><em>Thigh then. Fucking… thigh.</em></p>
<p>She hiked up her pant leg, exposing pale skin and the faint track
marks from previous emergency doses. Pressed the needle against the
muscle.</p>
<p><em>Gonna take longer to kick in. Hate this. Fuck. This.</em></p>
<p>But it was the only option that didn’t require contortionist bullshit
or risking her good arm.</p>
<p>She pushed the needle in, felt the resistance of muscle tissue, and
pressed the plunger slowly. The PYRA burned as it spread through the
injection site.</p>
<p><em>Come on. Work faster. Please.</em></p>
<p>She pulled the needle out, tossed it onto the cabinet, and let out a
slow breath.</p>
<p>The shaking didn’t ease immediately. Her vision stayed fuzzy at the
edges. The drug had to work its way through muscle before hitting her
bloodstream, and that took <em>time</em> she didn’t have.</p>
<p><em>Should’ve done two doses. No—don’t. Stay controlled. It’ll kick
in. Just… slower.</em></p>
<p>“TIME’S UP, DOG.”</p>
<p>“COMING,” she barked back, grabbing her jacket off the floor and
tossing it over her head. Fabric smothered her face. She groped blindly
for a sleeve hole—found something sleeve-like, shoved her arm toward
it.</p>
<p>Didn’t go through.</p>
<p>She pushed harder. Still nothing.</p>
<p><em>What the—</em></p>
<p>She yanked the jacket down enough to see. Her arm was pressed against
solid fabric. Not a hole at all. The hood.</p>
<p><em>Wait, if the hood’s there, then is this thing upside down? How is
it—what?</em></p>
<p>She ripped the jacket off completely, held it up, scowled and mouthed
a silent <em>what</em>, then turned it around. Right side up. Definitely
right side up.</p>
<p><em>Okay. Again.</em></p>
<p>She tossed it back over her head, now the hood was on her face.
Darkness. Searched for the sleeve hole—<em>there</em>—shoved her arm
through. It went in smoothly this time, <em>thank fuck</em>. She
wrestled the hood off her face, blinking in the light.</p>
<p>The jacket hung off her left shoulder. The other side dangled loose
and empty.</p>
<p>She tried to shimmy it around her body.</p>
<p>It didn’t move.</p>
<p>She tried again, twisting her torso.</p>
<p>Still stuck.</p>
<p><em>Why is it—</em></p>
<p>She looked down.</p>
<p>The jacket was on backwards. Sleeve on the front, collar twisted
around her neck like it was trying to strangle her.</p>
<p><em>You’ve gotta be fucking kidding me.</em></p>
<p><em>THIS IS A JACKET. A JACKET. NOT SOME ADVANCED ENGINEERING. FABRIC
WITH HOLES. YOU ARE FAILING. AT. FABRIC. WITH HOLES.</em></p>
<p>She ripped it off. Again. Started over. <em>Again.</em></p>
<p>Third time: hood on head, arm through sleeve—<em>correct</em> sleeve
this time—hood shoved back, TWIST BODY, catch other side with shoulder,
SET IT RIGHT on said shoulder with arm that actually exists, jacket now
hanging the right way around body. <em>FINALLY.</em></p>
<p>The right side hung loose, empty and wrong, but at least she was
<em>wearing</em> it.</p>
<p>“The fuck are you doing in there?!”</p>
<p>“GETTING DRESSED,” Hellhound yelled back, slightly manic.</p>
<p>“The fuck are you putting on—”</p>
<p>“MONSTER’S GOT TWO SLEEVES AND I’VE ONLY GOT ONE ARM SO MAYBE GIVE ME
A FUCKING SECOND—”</p>
<p>She grabbed the door handle, yanked it open, and came face-to-face
with a scowling Marauder who looked two seconds away from kicking her
instead of the door.</p>
<p>“Took you long enough.”</p>
<p>Hellhound grinned at him, still a little unhinged from the laughter.
“Needed my make-up routine. You know how it is.”</p>
<p>The guard looked her up and down—one arm, disheveled hair, manic
grin—and scoffed.</p>
<p>“Empress is gonna eat you alive.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, probably,” Hellhound said cheerfully, stepping past him into
the hall. “Let’s get it over with.”</p>
