CHAOS: CHAPTER II – DROUGHTBREAK</h1>
<p>“Get out.” Nyx’s voice echoed in the church hall. The muttering
slaves suddenly fell silent.</p>
<p>Hellhound tried to gather herself quickly, but it was difficult with
only one arm. She drew her shoulder forward, checking the damage on the
junction. The interface itself didn’t seem to be damaged; only the
socket that kept her arm anchored had failed.</p>
<p>She glanced at Nyx. She was walking away. Time felt like it both
stalled and sped up.</p>
<p><em>Can’t let her walk away, what if she doesn’t know that I’m, no, I
can’t, I have to…</em></p>
<p>She shook her head quickly.</p>
<p><em>No that’s not it, I can’t let her know how much I need that arm.
But fuck, what if she thinks it’s just a toy, it’s not a toy, I NEED IT,
I fucking need it, what if she doesn’t know I’m gonna die from this,
what if she just thinks she took my toy, what if she thinks this is just
a little game what if–</em></p>
<p>She shook her head again. Her breathing quickened, her throat
tightened and her eyes burned.</p>
<p>She punched herself in the jaw.</p>
<p>Then shook her head again.</p>
<p>Took a deep breath.</p>
<p>Stood up, forced a quick huff through her nose and walked out of the
church hall.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Walking felt wrong. Her balance felt wrong. Her right side suddenly
felt too light. She had to compensate not to eat dirt. Turns out the arm
was the difference between Hellhound <em>and a cripple.</em></p>
<p>She grunted as she pushed the church door open with her side.</p>
<p>That was when she realized something.</p>
<p>The darkness bleeding in from the outside stopped feeling
comforting.</p>
<p>Her safeguard. Her damn fucking circuit breaker.</p>
<p>The one thing that meant there was always a next move. Strength,
agility, regulation, all of it a flick of her wrist away.</p>
<p>Her system had always been designed with the worst case scenario in
mind. One failsafe. One margin that kept her above water no matter how
bad it got.</p>
<p>And now it was gone. Taken. Somewhere. No idea when or <em>if</em>
she’d get it back.</p>
<p>And now she felt like a bleeding prey in the middle of the ocean full
of predators. She knew they’d caught her scent, but where were they
hiding now? Watching her from the shadows, waiting for her to leave the
light of the Empress’s church, so they can finally lunge and take her
apart.</p>
<p>Her judge kept telling her she deserved this. Even if she dies, even
if Skull hunts her down, she deserves it. Because she provoked, took
things for granted, thought this wouldn’t catch up to her. And now the
bill was finally arriving, slow but certain. She failed to see this,
failed to calculate this outcome because her fucking arrogance made her
blind, made her think she’s ABOVE IT ALL, BECAUSE SHE HAD HER DRUGS, SHE
HAD HER ARM, HER FIRE, EXCEPT THIS WAS NOT HER TERRITORY, THIS IS NOT
HER STUPID PLAYGROUND TO BURN, AND FOR SOME IDIOTIC REASON, SHE FORGOT
WHO SHE WAS HERE OR WHAT SHE WANTED IN THE FIRST PLACE.</p>
<p><em>To prove her competence.</em></p>
<p>But once again, she managed to prove her volatility. How much of a
liability she was.</p>
<p>She started walking. The last drops of Pyra in her blood still gave
her some edge in the darkness, her focus was everywhere, monitoring
movements, shadows, flickers, sounds.</p>
<p>She couldn’t afford to overthink this anymore. Even though her rented
room wasn’t far from there, the distance felt endless. She felt too
exposed, defenceless.</p>
<p>Light.<br />
Footsteps.<br />
Dirt barely crunching.</p>
<p>And no bones rattling.</p>
<p>The blood froze in Hellhound.</p>
<p>She forced herself to breathe. The one approaching her was
hesitating. Careful. Giving her options. That meant she was still
alive.</p>
<p>She turned. Too late. The shape was closer than she’d expected. The
footsteps didn’t stop, moving toward her casually.</p>
<p>Too casual. Not predatory.</p>
<p>Which scared Hellhound more.</p>
<p>The scattered light from shacks and windows finally caught the
figure: a lean woman. Nothing like the Marauders.</p>
<p>A settler? No. Why would a settler be here at night. A trader, maybe.
Someone’s fancy slave. That made more sense.</p>
<p>Or a whore.</p>
<p>She swallowed.</p>
<p>How low was the bar, trying to pick up a cripple limping through the
dark?</p>
<p>She had a gun. Not raised. Not aiming at Hellhound.</p>
<p>Why would—</p>
<p>The woman snorted a laugh.</p>
<p>“You look like it’s not just your arm that decided to go on a
vacation, Hellhound.”</p>
