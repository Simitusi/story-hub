CHAOS: CHAPTER II – DROUGHTBREAK</h1>
<p>“Get out.” Nyx’s voice echoed in the church hall. The muttering
slaves suddenly fell silent.</p>
<p>Hellhound tried to gather herself quickly, but it was difficult with
only one arm. She drew her shoulder forward, checking the damage to the
junction. The interface itself didn’t seem to be damaged; only the
socket that kept her arm anchored had failed.</p>
<p>She glanced at Nyx. She was walking away. Time felt like it both
stalled and sped up.</p>
<p><em>Can’t let her walk away.<br />
What if she doesn’t know that I’m—<br />
No, I can’t, I have to…</em></p>
<p>She shook her head quickly.</p>
<p><em>No that’s not it, I can’t let her know how much I need that arm.
But fuck, what if she thinks it’s just a toy, it’s not a toy, I NEED IT,
I fucking need it, what if she doesn’t know I’m gonna die from this,
what if she just thinks she took my toy, what if she thinks this is just
a little game what if–</em></p>
<p>She shook her head again. Her breathing quickened, her throat
tightened and her eyes burned.</p>
<p>She punched herself in the jaw.</p>
<p>Then shook her head again.</p>
<p>Took a deep breath.</p>
<p>Stood up, forced a quick huff through her nose and walked out of the
church hall.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Walking felt wrong. Her balance felt wrong. Her right side suddenly
felt too light. She had to compensate not to eat dirt. Turns out the arm
was the difference between Hellhound <em>and a cripple.</em></p>
<p>She grunted as she pushed the church door open with her side.</p>
<p>That was when she realized something.</p>
<p>The darkness bleeding in from the outside stopped feeling
comforting.</p>
<p>Her safeguard. Her damn fucking circuit breaker.</p>
<p>The one thing that meant there was always a next move. Strength,
agility, regulation, all of it a flick of her wrist away.</p>
<p>Her system had always been designed with the worst case scenario in
mind. One failsafe. One margin that kept her above water no matter how
bad it got.</p>
<p>And now it was gone. Taken. Somewhere. No idea when or <em>if</em>
she’d get it back.</p>
<p>And now she felt like a bleeding prey in the middle of the ocean full
of predators. She knew they’d caught her scent, but where were they
hiding? Watching her from the shadows, waiting for her to leave the
light of the Empress’s church, so they can finally lunge and take her
apart.</p>
<p>Her judge kept telling her she deserved this. Even if she dies, even
if Skull hunts her down, she deserves it. Because she provoked, took
things for granted, thought this wouldn’t catch up to her. And now the
bill was finally arriving, slow but certain. She failed to see this
because her arrogance made her blind, made her think she’s above it ALL,
BECAUSE SHE HAD HER DRUGS, SHE HAD HER ARM, HER FIRE, EXCEPT THIS WAS
NOT HER STUPID PLAYGROUND TO BURN, AND SHE FORGOT WHY SHE WAS THERE IN
THE FIRST PLACE.</p>
<p><em>To prove her competence.</em></p>
<p>But once again, she managed to prove her volatility. How much of a
liability she was.</p>
<p>She started walking. The last drops of Pyra in her blood still gave
her some edge in the darkness, her focus was everywhere, monitoring
movements, shadows, flickers, sounds.</p>
<p>She couldn’t afford to overthink this anymore. Even though her rented
room wasn’t far from there, the distance felt endless. She felt too
exposed, defenseless.</p>
<p>Light.<br />
Footsteps.<br />
Dirt barely crunching.</p>
<p>And no bones rattling.</p>
<p>Hellhound’s whole body locked up.</p>
<p>She forced herself to breathe. The one approaching her was
hesitating. Careful. Giving her options. That meant she was still
alive.</p>
<p>She turned. Too late. The shape was closer than she’d expected. The
footsteps didn’t stop, moving toward her casually.</p>
<p>Too casual. Not predatory.</p>
<p>Which scared Hellhound more.</p>
<p>The scattered light from shacks and windows finally revealed the
figure: a lean, blonde woman. Nothing like the Marauders.</p>
<p>A settler? No. Why would a settler be here at night. A trader, maybe.
Someone’s fancy slave. That made more sense.</p>
<p>Or someone’s…entertainment for the night.</p>
<p>She swallowed.</p>
<p>How low was the bar, trying to pick up a cripple limping through the
dark?</p>
<p>She had a gun. Not raised. Not aiming at Hellhound.</p>
<p><em>Why would—</em></p>
<p>The woman snorted a laugh.</p>
<p>“You look like it’s not just your arm that decided to go on a
vacation, Hellhound.”</p>
<p>“Who the hell—”</p>
<p>“Mmm, does it really matter?” The woman circled her with long,
playful strides. “But call me Blink if you must.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, sure. I don’t have time for this, so let me just—”</p>
<p>Shots fired, dirt exploded right between Hellhound’s feet. Hellhound
jumped.</p>
<p>“Jesus, woman, what the fuck?”</p>
<p>“Oops. My hands are just <em>very</em> twitchy.”</p>
<p>Blink stepped closer to Hellhound, tilting her head as a smug smirk
crept up her face.</p>
<p>“Poor stray, crippled puppy,” Blink stepped into Hellhound’s space,
hands brushing her right shoulder. “I might be able to help you out,”
her voice dropped. “If you behave.”</p>
<p>Hellhound stepped back. Shook her head. Tried to gather her
thoughts.<br />
Her thoughts never showed up.</p>
<p>“I don’t need help, I’m—”</p>
<p>“Oh really? Might be my memory failing me, but isn’t there a bad
little cannibal looking for you?”</p>
<p>Hellhound swallowed, then frowned. Blink’s smile grew wider.</p>
<p>Hellhound rolled her eyes. “I’ve already taken care of that
problem.”</p>
<p><em>She did not.</em></p>
<p>Blink shrugged. “Well, whatever then,” she turned to leave. She
reached into her pockets, then pulled out a few syringes filled with
thick red liquid. “Then I will just find a better place for these.”</p>
<p>Hellhound’s head snapped up.</p>
<p>PYRA.</p>
<p>Those few shots could keep her functioning a bit longer.<br />
<em>Don’t show desperation. Can’t announce weakness.</em></p>
<p>“Wait.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Blink stopped, then gracefully turned on her heels to face Hellhound
again, gun pressed flat against her lower back as she leaned forward
onto her toes.</p>
<p>“What do you want for those?” Hellhound rasped.</p>
<p>“Do you have sweets?”</p>
<p><em>The what now.</em></p>
<p>Hellhound blinked.</p>
<p>“I can just give some random drugs—”</p>
<p>Blink dropped one of the syringes. It hit the ground and rolled. She
stepped on it, twisting her metal-toed boot, to make sure the glass
crunched into pieces and the liquid bled into the dirt.</p>
<p>“Hmm, I should really get my hands checked.”</p>
<p>Hellhound’s eye twitched but she quickly reached into her pocket. She
managed to fish out three half melted bonbons, and tossed them to Blink.
Blink caught them all without much effort, and looked awfully delighted
about her newly acquired treasure.</p>
<p>“Come.”</p>
<p>Hellhound groaned, but followed her.</p>
<p><em>I guess she will give me the drugs later.<br />
Or was she joking?<br />
Aghh, if I ask again, she might break another one.<br />
What is she even doing, escorting me?</em></p>
<p>They were heading towards the guest quarters, towards Hellhound’s
room. The silence around them felt wrong. This was far from what
Hellhound predicted.<br />
She thought the moment she set foot in the darkness, she would get
attacked. Even with Blink escorting her, the situation didn’t feel much
safer. But somehow it worked.</p>
<p><em>Maybe Skull wouldn’t attack her with company?<br />
Makes sense, after all, Nyx’s guards held him at gunpoint too.<br />
He hunted only when he could avoid leaving a trace.<br />
Which raised another question.</em></p>
<p>“Why are you even escorting me?”</p>
<p>“Because you’re funny. Now you can be funny for longer.”</p>
<p>Hellhound blinked. Twice. Her eye twitched again.</p>
<p>“Excuse me?”</p>
<p>“What.”</p>
<p>At the gates Blink shoved the remaining syringes into Hellhound’s
chest. Hellhound barely managed to catch them with her one intact arm,
fumbling.</p>
<p>“How did you—”</p>
<p>“Hmm, now you DO have time for this, Hellhound?” Blink’s grin
widened. “Let’s just say I was bored.”</p>
<p>“Bored.”</p>
<p>“Very.” Blink yawned, stretched. “Night shift is a real drag.”<br />
She turned, waved without looking back. “Don’t die. I don’t like losing
my sweets supply.”</p>
<p>She was already gone.</p>
<p>Hellhound exhaled through her nose. She glanced down at the syringes
and frowned. Then turned and entered the guest quarters.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>She flopped into her bed and groaned into the mattress.</p>
<p><em>Shouldn’t have left this damn room.</em></p>
<p>Turning her head, she glanced at the syringes she set on the bedside
cabinet.</p>
<p><em>Two doses should give enough time. Just have to keep it
controlled.<br />
Tomorrow is another day.</em></p>
<p>She sat up and crossed her legs, digging into her pockets and dumping
everything onto the bed. Plastic ampules, powder packets, pills piling
together.</p>
<p>Rubbing her face with one hand, she sighed.</p>
<p><em>I have no clue what these idiots even value. Rats loved AX,
doesn’t mean it will work here. They have these…marks or whatever. Marks
over pills huh. Whatever.</em></p>
<p>Head shake. Her nails dug into her thigh.</p>
<p><em>Even if these are worth close to nothing here, worst case, I
could still get some PYRA for these. Well if they have PYRA. Fucking…
fuck me why are you built so damn picky…</em></p>
<p>She swept the drugs aside, exhaled hard, and walked to the
bathroom.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the room had water. Wouldn’t try drinking from it
though. Or getting it in the eyes.<br />
The thought made her shiver – had to shake her hands off… well,
<em>one</em> hand. Her other shoulder jerked too, out of habit. Her body
still believed she had her other arm.</p>
<p>Looking into the mirror, she turned so she could inspect the junction
properly now.</p>
<p><em>Nerve endings still sealed up. That’s good. Socket hinge is
broken but it’s an easy repair. Connector pins seem intact too.<br />
Ahhh, fuck you Nyx, you did such a clean job.<br />
Just…</em></p>
<p>Her breathing got faster. She huffed through her nose as her throat
tightened, panic growing in her stomach again.</p>
<p><em>Just please don’t fuck up that arm. Please.</em></p>
<p>She took a deep, slow breath, kept it in, and exhaled slowly. Then
looked at her own face in the cracked mirror.</p>
<p><em>You look so broken, pull it together.</em></p>
<p>Leaning closer, she pulled the skin of her cheek down to inspect her
own eye.</p>
<p><em>Lookin’ fine. Everything’s fine.</em></p>
<p>She cranked the tap, splashed some water onto herself.</p>
<p><em>Don’t want to bother with a full bath. So tired already.<br />
But…<br />
What if I won’t get access to water later? Could be days before I get
another chance.<br />
Long trip before meant no water for—<br />
No, stop, you’re spiraling, just pick—<br />
But I wanna sleeeeep.<br />
If I get in, I ain’t getting out for hours.<br />
Except what if Nyx wants me tomorrow and I’m filthy and she decides I’m
not worth—</em></p>
<p><em>STOOOP.</em></p>
<p>She finally let the water run and hunched over the tub with a
defeated groan.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The bath had taken hours. Sleep, when it came, lasted three. Pounding
on the door jolted her awake, before the sun even broke.</p>
<p>“Rise and shine, dog, Empress be calling ya!”</p>
<p>Hellhound scowled into her mattress, curling up on herself to shield
herself from the noise.</p>
<p>A loud bang made the door let out a pathetic crack.</p>
<p>“Fucking SAY something!”</p>
<p>Another kick.</p>
<p>“Jeez, I hear you, I hear you,” Hellhound groaned. “What’d that door
ever do to you.”</p>
<p>“Get your ass UP. Nyx don’t like waiting.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, yeah, give me a fucking minute—”</p>
<p>“You got thirty seconds before I kick this thing off its hinges.”</p>
<p>Hellhound growled into her pillow, then shoved herself upright.</p>
<p>Or tried to.</p>
<p>Her left arm pushed down into the mattress. Her right arm pushed down
into nothing.</p>
<p>She face-planted.</p>
<p>Her nose hit the sheets hard enough to make her eyes water. For a
second, she just laid there, completely still, processing what her body
had just done.</p>
<p>Then a sound bubbled up from her chest. A wheeze. Then a snort.</p>
<p>Then full, unhinged laughter.</p>
<p>She rolled onto her back, clutching her stomach with her one working
hand, cackling at the ceiling like an absolute maniac. Her shoulder—the
empty one—jerked with the motion, phantom limb still trying to
participate.</p>
<p><em>I forgot. I fucking FORGOT I don’t have an arm. What the fuck.
What the FUCK.</em></p>
<p>The laughter turned breathless, tears leaking from the corners of her
eyes. Her brain couldn’t process the absurdity anymore and just gave
up.</p>
<p>“You fucking high?!”</p>
<p>That made her laugh harder.</p>
<p>“Yeah, no, I mean,” she wheezed. “I’m—” She sucked in air, trying to
get words out.<br />
“I’m fine, just—” Another snort escaped. “Just tripped.”</p>
<p>“The fuck are you tripping on, it’s been ten seconds—”</p>
<p>“Nothing, I’m fine!” She was still laughing. “Just—fuck, I’m getting
up, hold on—”</p>
<p>Silence from the other side of the door.</p>
<p>“…You hit your head or something?”</p>
<p>“Probably!” She was still giggling, wiping her eyes with the back of
her hand. “Fuck, okay. Okay, I’m getting up. For real.”</p>
<p>She rolled onto her side, then used her left arm— her only arm, —to
push herself into a sitting position. Slower this time. Compensating for
the weight imbalance.</p>
<p>There we go. Like a functional person. <em>Sort of.</em></p>
<p><em>Boots. Fuck. How…</em></p>
<p>She slipped her feet into them, fell back onto the bed and raised her
legs above her head. Gravity did the rest as the laces hung right above
her mouth. She caught them with her teeth, pulled and tied it with her
intact hand.</p>
<p>She stumbled to the cabinet, grabbed one of Blink’s syringes, and
stared at it.</p>
<p><em>Manual injection. Great. Love this for me.</em></p>
<p>She uncapped the syringe with her teeth, pressed the needle against
her thigh, hunting for the right angle. Her hand shook. But not from
withdrawal, not yet at least. Just exhaustion. Three hours of sleep and
a missing arm would do that.</p>
<p>She pressed the needle against her forearm, hunting for the right
angle.</p>
<p><em>Wait. Fuck.</em><br />
<em>Can’t stabilize the arm and inject it at the same time. Not
one-handed.</em></p>
<p>She pulled back, scowling at the syringe.</p>
<p><em>Thigh then. Fucking… thigh.</em></p>
<p>She hiked up her pant leg, exposing pale skin and the faint track
marks from previous emergency doses. Pressed the needle against the
muscle.</p>
<p><em>Gonna take longer to kick in. Hate this. Fuck. This.</em></p>
<p>But it was the only option that didn’t require contortionist bullshit
or risking her good arm.</p>
<p>She pushed the needle in, felt the resistance of muscle tissue, and
pressed the plunger slowly. The PYRA burned as it spread through the
injection site.</p>
<p><em>Come on. Work faster. Please.</em></p>
<p>She pulled the needle out, tossed it onto the cabinet, and let out a
slow breath.</p>
<p>The shaking didn’t ease immediately. Her vision stayed fuzzy at the
edges. The drug had to work its way through muscle before hitting her
bloodstream, and that took <em>time</em> she didn’t have.</p>
<p><em>Should’ve done two doses. No—don’t. Stay controlled. It’ll kick
in. Just… slower.</em></p>
<p>“TIME’S UP, DOG.”</p>
<p>“COMING,” she barked back, grabbing her jacket off the floor and
tossing it over her head. Fabric smothered her face. She groped blindly
for a sleeve hole—found something sleeve-like, shoved her arm toward
it.</p>
<p>Didn’t go through.</p>
<p>She pushed harder. Still nothing.</p>
<p><em>What the—</em></p>
<p>She yanked the jacket down enough to see. Her arm was pressed against
solid fabric. Not a hole at all. The hood.</p>
<p><em>Wait, if the hood’s there, then is this thing upside down? How is
it—what?</em></p>
<p>She ripped the jacket off completely, held it up, scowled and mouthed
a silent <em>what</em>, then turned it around. Right side up. Definitely
right side up.</p>
<p><em>Okay. Again.</em></p>
<p>She tossed it back over her head, now the hood was on her face.
Darkness. Searched for the sleeve hole—<em>there</em>—shoved her arm
through. It went in smoothly this time, <em>thank fuck</em>. She
wrestled the hood off her face, blinking in the light.</p>
<p>The jacket hung off her left shoulder. The other side dangled loose
and empty.</p>
<p>She tried to shimmy it around her body.</p>
<p>It didn’t move.</p>
<p>She tried again, twisting her torso.</p>
<p>Still stuck.</p>
<p><em>Why is it—</em></p>
<p>She looked down.</p>
<p>The jacket was on backwards. Sleeve on the front, collar twisted
around her neck like it was trying to strangle her.</p>
<p><em>You’ve gotta be fucking kidding me.</em></p>
<p><em>THIS IS A JACKET. A JACKET. NOT SOME ADVANCED ENGINEERING. FABRIC
WITH HOLES. YOU ARE FAILING. AT. FABRIC. WITH HOLES.</em></p>
<p>She ripped it off. Again. Started over. <em>Again.</em></p>
<p>Third time: hood on head, arm through sleeve—<em>correct</em> sleeve
this time—hood shoved back, TWIST BODY, catch other side with shoulder,
SET IT RIGHT on said shoulder with arm that actually exists, jacket now
hanging the right way around body. <em>FINALLY.</em></p>
<p>The right side hung loose, empty and wrong, but at least she was
<em>wearing</em> it.</p>
<p>“Jesus Christ, what the fuck are you doing in there?!”</p>
<p>“GETTING DRESSED,” Hellhound yelled back, slightly manic.</p>
<p>“The hell are you putting on—”</p>
<p>“MONSTER’S GOT TWO SLEEVES AND I’VE ONLY GOT ONE ARM SO MAYBE GIVE ME
A FUCKING SECOND—”</p>
<p>She grabbed the door handle, yanked it open, and came face-to-face
with a scowling Marauder who looked two seconds away from kicking her
instead of the door.</p>
<p>“Took you long enough.”</p>
<p>Hellhound grinned at him, still a little unhinged from the laughter.
“Needed my make-up routine. You know how it is.”</p>
<p>The guard looked her up and down—one arm, disheveled hair, manic
grin—and scoffed.</p>
<p>“Empress is gonna eat you alive.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, probably,” Hellhound said cheerfully, stepping past him into
the hall. “Let’s get it over with.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The guard led her through the settlement, boots crunching dirt in a
rhythm that felt almost comforting. Predictable. Hellhound followed,
still riding the manic edge from the jacket incident, her brain
buzzing.</p>
<p><em>One foot, then the other. Don’t trip. You’ve done this before.
Walking. Classic activity. VERY normal.</em></p>
<p>The guard glanced back at her twice, like he was checking she hadn’t
wandered off or collapsed. She grinned at him both times. Too wide.
Unhinged.</p>
<p>He walked faster.</p>
<p><em>Yeah, that’s right. Speed it up. I’m fine. Totally fine.
Definitely not losing my fucking mind.</em></p>
<p>The gate came into view. Another guard was already there, leaning
against a pile of her gear. Her bike sat propped nearby, looking
intact.</p>
<p>“Empress said give it back,” the first guard said, jerking his thumb
towards the pile. “So. There.”</p>
<p>The second guard straightened, eyeing Hellhound with the kind of lazy
curiosity reserved for roadkill that’s still twitching.</p>
<p>“All of it?”</p>
<p>“All of it.”</p>
<p>“Huh.” He kicked at her pack. “Generous.”</p>
<p>Hellhound was already moving, dropping to her knees beside the pile
before either of them finished talking. Her hand shot out, grabbing the
first thing she recognized—her repair kit. She flipped it open.</p>
<p><em>Contents. Check. Needle-nose pliers, wire cutters, solder,
flux—</em></p>
<p>“Damn, she’s eager.”</p>
<p><em>—thermal paste, spare gaskets, backup seals—</em></p>
<p>Her fingers moved to the next item. Battery pack. She turned it over,
checking the casing for cracks.</p>
<p><em>Intact. Charge indicator still lit. Two bars left. Need to top it
off but it’ll hold.</em></p>
<p>“Yo, dog, you even listening?”</p>
<p>She grunted. Grabbed another pack. Heavier. Ammunition.</p>
<p><em>Rounds still here. They didn’t even count them. Sloppy.</em></p>
<p>Her hand found the vial case next. She cracked it open, and her
breath caught.</p>
<p><em>PYRA. Four vials. All intact.</em></p>
<p><em>Oh thank fuck. Thank FUCK.</em></p>
<p>She lifted one, inspecting it against the light. The red liquid
swirled inside, thick and viscous. <em>Beautiful.</em> Useless without
her arm’s injector, but there. Still hers.</p>
<p>“She’s smiling at drugs. Classic.”</p>
<p>Fuel canister. Flamethrower attachment—still here, didn’t even unbolt
it. <em>Meat grinder knuckles—</em></p>
<p>She pulled the brutal-looking augment from the pack, checked the
threading.</p>
<p><em>Clean. Good. Hydraulic lines intact. These idiots have no idea
what half this shit even does.</em></p>
<p>“Hey. HEY. Dog.”</p>
<p>She kept moving. <em>Rations—some missing. Water—half gone. Trade
supplies—</em></p>
<p>“You deaf or just stupid?”</p>
<p><em>Ammo untouched. More drugs in the false bottom—still there. They
rifled through but didn’t find it. Fucking amateurs.</em></p>
<p>A boot nudged her shoulder.</p>
<p>Hellhound flinched. Hard. Her whole body jerked away from the
contact, head snapping up, eyes wide.</p>
<p>The guard grinned. “Oh, she does move.”</p>
<p>The other one snorted. “Jumpy little thing, ain’t she?”</p>
<p>Hellhound’s jaw tightened. She forced her gaze back down to her gear,
fingers resuming their inventory.</p>
<p><em>Ignore them. Just finish. Fuel for the bike, fuel for the
flamethrower, both accounted for—</em></p>
<p>“So what happened to your arm, huh?” The first guard crouched down
next to her, getting in her space. “Nyx rip it off herself, or you just
forget where you left it?”</p>
<p><em>Repair manual still in the side pocket. Good. Spare
wiring—</em></p>
<p>“Bet she cried.”</p>
<p>“Nah, look at her now. Stone cold.”</p>
<p>Hellhound huffed through her nose. Sharp. Loud.</p>
<p>“Oh, there’s a sound. Thought maybe you went mute.”</p>
<p>Her fingers moved faster, checking, sorting, cataloging. Her judge
was screaming at her.</p>
<p><em>Pay attention to them, what if they say something useful and you
won’t hear it. They think you’re a junkie, they think you’re high as
kite. They think you’re an incompetent idiot on drugs. You’re making
this worse. FOCUS. No, focus on the GEAR, the gear matters, but they’re
making assumptions, they’re going to—</em></p>
<p>She shook her head. Once. Quick and sharp.</p>
<p><em>Stop. Inventory. Finish the inventory.</em></p>
<p>“Did she just—did you see that? She like, twitched.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, she’s been doing that. Whole way here, man, it was fucking
weird.” The first guard stood, miming the head shake. “Like a dog
shaking off water. Over and over.”</p>
<p>The second guard laughed. “Maybe the PYRA’s frying her brain.”</p>
<p>“Or maybe she’s always been this fucked.”</p>
<p>Hellhound cracked her knuckles. One by one. Starting with the
thumb.</p>
<p><em>Index. Middle. Ring. Pinky.</em></p>
<p>“Ooh, now she’s getting tough!”</p>
<p>“Right, dog? Right?” A hand slapped her shoulder. She flinched again,
harder this time. Her hand froze mid-reach for the next item.</p>
<p><em>Don’t. React. Just. Finish.</em></p>
<p>She exhaled through her nose. Longer this time. Almost a growl.</p>
<p>“She’s pissed.” The guard sounded delighted. “Look at her.”</p>
<p>“Bet she’s real fun at parties.”</p>
<p>“What parties? Who the fuck would invite this?”</p>
<p>Hellhound’s hand clenched around the strap of her pack. Her knuckles
went white.</p>
<p><em>They’re just talking. It’s noise. Background noise. Finish
the—</em></p>
<p>“Hey. Dog. You gonna talk or just sit there huffing like a pissed-off
mule?”</p>
<p>Her jaw worked. She didn’t look up.</p>
<p><em>Three-quarters through. Almost done. Ignore them. Just—</em></p>
<p>“Oh man, you shoulda seen her this morning.” The first guard was
warming up now, fully animated. “She took like five minutes to put on
her clothes.Like look at her. She only has a jacket. A JACKET. I’m
standing there, thinking she’s getting dressed in crazy armor or some
shit, and she’s just—” He mimed struggling with fabric. “—fighting a
jacket. Like it’s a fucking monster.”</p>
<p>The second guard howled. “No way.”</p>
<p>“I’m serious! She’s yelling about sleeves and arms and I’m just
standing there like, ‘is she having a stroke?’”</p>
<p>“What’d she say when she came out?”</p>
<p>“Something about make-up.” He cackled. “LOOK AT HER. Does she look
like she owns make-up?”</p>
<p>Hellhound’s hand moved to the next item. Slower now. Her breathing
was getting louder.</p>
<p><em>Just finish. Finish and they’ll stop. Finish and you
can—</em></p>
<p>A boot kicked lightly at her pack, jostling everything she’d just
organized.</p>
<p>“Yo. Talk, bitch.”</p>
<p>Her head snapped up.</p>
<p>Her eyes locked onto the guard. Yellow. Bright. Burning.</p>
<p>He grinned wider. “There she is.”</p>
<p>Hellhound’s lips twitched into a scowl, but she didn’t show more. No
teeth.</p>
<p>“Ooh, scary.”</p>
<p>She shook her head again. Harder this time. Trying to reset. Trying
to pull herself back.</p>
<p><em>Don’t. Do not. Just shut up.</em></p>
<p>“She’s gonna cry.”</p>
<p>“Nah, she’s gonna bite you.”</p>
<p>“That would give me rabies or some shit. She’s like half aberrant
already.”</p>
<p>Her hand shot back to her gear. Grabbed the last item. Checked it.
Shoved it into her pack.</p>
<p><em>Done. Inventory done. Everything done. Mostly. Close
enough.</em></p>
<p>She stood. Too fast. The world tilted slightly, but she locked her
knees and stayed upright.</p>
<p>The guards were still talking. Still laughing.</p>
<p>Her fist clenched. Unclenched. Clenched again. She rolled her
wrist.</p>
<p><em>Nyx. You’re waiting for Nyx. That’s all. Just wait for—</em></p>
<p>“What’s the matter, dog? You don’t like us?”</p>
<p>Hellhound huffed again. Louder. Sharper.</p>
<p>“She’s gonna snap.”</p>
<p>“Five marks says she tries to throw a punch.”</p>
<p>“With one arm? I’ll take that bet.”</p>
<p>Her jaw cracked from how hard she was clenching it. Her fingers found
her thumb. Started cracking knuckles again.</p>
<p><em>Thumb. Index. Middle. Ring—</em></p>
<p>“How long you think Nyx is gonna keep her around?”</p>
<p>“Day, maybe two.”</p>
<p>“She will get bored. Or she’ll break her.”</p>
<p>“Dude, look at her, bitch’s gonna fry herself before any of those
happen.”</p>
<p>Hellhound shook her head. Again. And again.</p>
<p>Shut up. Shut up, shut—</p>
<p>A hand landed on her shoulder. Heavy. Mocking.</p>
<p>She spun.</p>
<p>Her fist was already moving.</p>
<p>The guard blocked it mid-swing. Easily. He was armored, bigger,
stronger, and he knew it.</p>
<p>“Cute.”</p>
<p>Hellhound wrenched her arm back, stumbling slightly. Her balance was
still off without the prosthetic to counterweight her.</p>
<p>Both guards were laughing now. Full-bodied, genuine amusement.</p>
<p>“Oh man, she actually tried—”</p>
<p>“Told you. Told you she’d snap.”</p>
<p>“You owe me five marks.”</p>
<p>Hellhound’s chest heaved. Her vision narrowed. Her ears rang.</p>
<p><em>Fuck them. Fuck them. Fuck—</em></p>
<p>Footsteps.</p>
<p>Different ones. Heavier. Confident.</p>
<p>The guards stopped laughing immediately. Straightened. Their postures
shifted.</p>
<p>Hellhound turned.</p>
<p>Nyx was walking toward them.</p>
<p>And she looked nothing like the woman from the bar.</p>
<p>Metal chest plate caught the early light, dull and scratched, with
MARAUDERS carved deep into the steel. Asymmetrical spikes jutted from
her left shoulder, sharp and rusty, each one a different length like
jagged teeth. But it was the mask that made Hellhound’s breath
catch—half a face, crumpled scrap metal covering the right side of Nyx’s
features, leaving her left eye and that misleadingly warm smile
visible.</p>
<p>She dragged something behind her. A battleaxe. Makeshift,
rust-streaked, the head too big and the handle too long. It scraped
against the dirt with every step.</p>
<p>Who the fuck brings an axe to a gunfight.</p>
<p>But then she saw the sawed-off shotgun strapped to Nyx’s thigh.</p>
<p>Oh. Both. She brings both.</p>
<p>A guard was rolling a bike up behind her. Black frame, spikes welded
to every available surface, skulls mounted on the handlebars. And at the
back—</p>
<p>Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>A light machine gun. Mounted. Belt-fed. Huge drum magazine hanging
off the side like a tumor.</p>
<p>That thing probably weighs more than I do.</p>
<p>And then Hellhound saw it.</p>
<p>Her arm.</p>
<p>Hanging from Nyx’s hip.</p>
<p>Clipped to her belt like a fucking trophy.</p>
<p>Hellhound’s stomach dropped. Her vision narrowed. Her breathing
stopped.</p>
<p><em>There. Right there. She’s wearing it. She’s WEARING my arm like
it’s a goddamn accessory.</em></p>
<p>Her throat tightened. Her fist clenched. Her whole body locked
up.</p>
<p><em>Don’t react. Don’t give her the satisfaction. Don’t—</em></p>
<p>Nyx stopped a few paces away. The axe settled into the dirt with a
dull <em>thunk</em>. She rested one hand on the pommel, casual, like she
was leaning against a fence post.</p>
<p>Her eyes swept over the guards first.</p>
<p>“Morning, boys.” Her voice was casual. Easy. Like she was greeting
drinking buddies.</p>
<p>The guards scrambled to respond.</p>
<p>“Morning, Empress!”</p>
<p>“Good to see you, Empress!”</p>
<p>Their voices were too loud. Too eager. Trying way too hard to sound
relaxed.</p>
<p>Nyx’s smile widened just slightly. She knew.</p>
<p>“You two look like you’ve been having fun.” She nodded toward
Hellhound. “Dog keeping you entertained?”</p>
<p>One of the guards laughed. Too fast. “Yeah, she’s a riot, Empress.
Real character.”</p>
<p>“Character,” Nyx repeated, tasting the word. “That’s generous.”</p>
<p>The other guard shifted his weight. “She, uh, tried to punch me
earlier.”</p>
<p>“Did she now.” Nyx glanced at Hellhound. Not surprised. Not even
mildly interested. Just noting it.</p>
<p>Hellhound said nothing. Her gaze flicked from Nyx’s face to the arm
hanging from her hip, then back.</p>
<p><em>Don’t look at it. Don’t stare. She wants you to stare.</em></p>
<p>“Did you punch back?” Nyx asked the guard.</p>
<p>“Caught her wrist, Empress. Didn’t want to, uh, damage your
property.”</p>
<p>Nyx snorted. “Smart man.”</p>
<p>The guard puffed up slightly, pleased.</p>
<p>Hellhound’s jaw tightened.</p>
<p><em>Your property. Right. That’s what I am now.</em></p>
<p>Nyx turned fully toward Hellhound now, her eyes sweeping over the
pile of gear.</p>
<p>“Got everything?”</p>
<p>Hellhound blinked. The question was neutral. Almost professional.
Like they were colleagues.</p>
<p>“Yeah.” Her voice came out rougher than she meant. “Mostly.”</p>
<p>“Mostly?”</p>
<p>“Some water and rations are missing.”</p>
<p>Nyx shrugged. “You’ll live.”</p>
<p>She crouched down, inspecting the bike with the same casual authority
she brought to everything. Ran her hand over the frame, checked the fuel
gauge, nodded once.</p>
<p>“Good. You’re riding with me today.”</p>
<p>Hellhound’s stomach twisted. “Where?”</p>
<p>“Just a friendly visit.” Nyx straightened, brushing dirt off her
hands. “Allied settlement. About an hour south. They’ve been a little…
forgetful about their taxes lately.”</p>
<p>One of the guards chuckled. “Encouragement run.”</p>
<p>Nyx smiled. “Mhm.”</p>
<p>The guard looked pleased with himself, like he’d just passed a
test.</p>
<p>Hellhound watched the exchange. Cataloged it.</p>
<p>They’re terrified. Look at them. Trying so hard to seem casual.
Laughing at her jokes. Agreeing too fast. They want her to think they’re
cool. That they’re in on it.</p>
<p>But they’re not.</p>
<p>Nyx’s posture was relaxed. Her tone light. But the guards stood just
a little too stiff. Smiled just a little too wide. Their eyes kept
darting to the axe. The bike. The arm.</p>
<p>The problem wasn’t only what Nyx was capable of. But the fact that
Nyx loved making examples. And they’re praying she doesn’t decide to
remind them.</p>
<p>“Hellhound.”</p>
<p>Hellhound’s head snapped up. Nyx was looking at her now, head tilted
slightly.</p>
<p>“You good to ride?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>“One-armed?”</p>
<p>There it was. The acknowledgment. But Nyx’s tone didn’t change. No
mockery. No gloating. Just a practical question.</p>
<p>Hellhound’s throat tightened. “I’ll manage.”</p>
<p>“Good.” Nyx turned back to the guards. “Get her bike fueled. We leave
in ten.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Empress!”</p>
<p>They scrambled to obey, almost tripping over each other.</p>
<p>Nyx watched them go, her smile never faltering. Then she glanced at
Hellhound again.</p>
<p>“You eat yet?”</p>
<p>Hellhound blinked. “What?”</p>
<p>“Breakfast. Did you eat.”</p>
<p>“No? It’s fucking 4 a.m., why would I—”</p>
<p>“Is this a hobby of yours? Forgetting who you’re talking to?”</p>
<p>Hellhound swallowed and looked away.</p>
<p>Nyx pulled something from her belt. Tossed it.</p>
<p>Hellhound barely caught it one-handed. A pack of… jerkies? Tied up
but already opened.</p>
<p>“Eat. You look like shit.”</p>
<p>Hellhound stared at the pack. Then at Nyx.</p>
<p>Nyx was already walking toward her bike, the axe dragging behind her
again.</p>
<p>“And Hellhound?”</p>
<p>“Yeah?”</p>
<p>Nyx glanced back over her shoulder. Her visible eye glinted.</p>
<p>“Don’t expect me to drag deadweight.”</p>
