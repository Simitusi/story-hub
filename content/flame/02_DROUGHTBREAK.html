CHAOS: CHAPTER II – DROUGHTBREAK</h1>
<p>“Get out.” Nyx’s voice echoed in the church hall. The muttering
slaves suddenly fell silent.</p>
<p>Hellhound tried to gather herself quickly, but it was difficult with
only one arm. She drew her shoulder forward, checking the damage on the
junction. The interface itself didn’t seem to be damaged; only the
socket that kept her arm anchored had failed.</p>
<p>She glanced at Nyx. She was walking away. Time felt like it both
stalled and sped up.</p>
<p><em>Can’t let her walk away, what if she doesn’t know that I’m, no, I
can’t, I have to…</em></p>
<p>She shook her head quickly.</p>
<p><em>No that’s not it, I can’t let her know how much I need that arm.
But fuck, what if she thinks it’s just a toy, it’s not a toy, I NEED IT,
I fucking need it, what if she doesn’t know I’m gonna die from this,
what if she just thinks she took my toy, what if she thinks this is just
a little game what if–</em></p>
<p>She shook her head again. Her breathing quickened, her throat
tightened and her eyes burned.</p>
<p>She punched herself in the jaw.</p>
<p>Then shook her head again.</p>
<p>Took a deep breath.</p>
<p>Stood up, forced a quick huff through her nose and walked out of the
church hall.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Walking felt wrong. Her balance felt wrong. Her right side suddenly
felt too light. She had to compensate not to eat dirt. Turns out the arm
was the difference between Hellhound <em>and a cripple.</em></p>
<p>She grunted as she pushed the church door open with her side.</p>
<p>That was when she realized something.</p>
<p>The darkness bleeding in from the outside stopped feeling
comforting.</p>
<p>Her safeguard. Her damn fucking circuit breaker.</p>
<p>The one thing that meant there was always a next move. Strength,
agility, regulation, all of it a flick of her wrist away.</p>
<p>Her system had always been designed with the worst case scenario in
mind. One failsafe. One margin that kept her above water no matter how
bad it got.</p>
<p>And now it was gone. Taken. Somewhere. No idea when or <em>if</em>
she’d get it back.</p>
<p>And now she felt like a bleeding prey in the middle of the ocean full
of predators. She knew they’d caught her scent, but where were they
hiding now? Watching her from the shadows, waiting for her to leave the
light of the Empress’s church, so they can finally lunge and take her
apart.</p>
<p>Her judge kept telling her she deserved this. Even if she dies, even
if Skull hunts her down, she deserves it. Because she provoked, took
things for granted, thought this wouldn’t catch up to her. And now the
bill was finally arriving, slow but certain. She failed to see this
because her arrogance made her blind, made her think she’s above it ALL,
BECAUSE SHE HAD HER DRUGS, SHE HAD HER ARM, HER FIRE, EXCEPT THIS WAS
NOT HER STUPID PLAYGROUND TO BURN, AND SHE FORGOT WHY SHE WAS THERE IN
THE FIRST PLACE.</p>
<p><em>To prove her competence.</em></p>
<p>But once again, she managed to prove her volatility. How much of a
liability she was.</p>
<p>She started walking. The last drops of Pyra in her blood still gave
her some edge in the darkness, her focus was everywhere, monitoring
movements, shadows, flickers, sounds.</p>
<p>She couldn’t afford to overthink this anymore. Even though her rented
room wasn’t far from there, the distance felt endless. She felt too
exposed, defenceless.</p>
<p>Light.<br />
Footsteps.<br />
Dirt barely crunching.</p>
<p>And no bones rattling.</p>
<p>The blood froze in Hellhound.</p>
<p>She forced herself to breathe. The one approaching her was
hesitating. Careful. Giving her options. That meant she was still
alive.</p>
<p>She turned. Too late. The shape was closer than she’d expected. The
footsteps didn’t stop, moving toward her casually.</p>
<p>Too casual. Not predatory.</p>
<p>Which scared Hellhound more.</p>
<p>The scattered light from shacks and windows finally caught the
figure: a lean woman. Nothing like the Marauders.</p>
<p>A settler? No. Why would a settler be here at night. A trader, maybe.
Someone’s fancy slave. That made more sense.</p>
<p>Or a whore.</p>
<p>She swallowed.</p>
<p>How low was the bar, trying to pick up a cripple limping through the
dark?</p>
<p>She had a gun. Not raised. Not aiming at Hellhound.</p>
<p><em>Why would—</em></p>
<p>The woman snorted a laugh.</p>
<p>“You look like it’s not just your arm that decided to go on a
vacation, Hellhound.”</p>
<p>“Who the hell—”</p>
<p>“Mmm, does it really matter?” The woman circled her with long,
playful strides. “But call me Blink if you must.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, sure. I don’t have time for this, so let me just—”</p>
<p>Shots fired, dirt exploded right between Hellhound’s feet. Hellhound
jumped.</p>
<p>“Jesus, woman, what the fuck?”</p>
<p>“Oops. My hands are just <em>very</em> twitchy.”</p>
<p>Blink stepped closer to Hellhound, tilting her head as a smug smirk
crept up her face.</p>
<p>“Poor stray, crippled puppy,” Blink stepped into Hellhound’s space,
hands brushing her right shoulder. “I might be able to help you out,”
her voice dropped. “If you behave.”</p>
<p>Hellhound stepped back. Shook her head. Tried to gather her
thoughts.<br />
Her thoughts never showed up.</p>
<p>“I don’t need help, I’m—”</p>
<p>“Oh really? Might be my memory failing me, but isn’t there a bad
little cannibal looking for you?”</p>
<p>Hellhound swallowed, then frowned. Blink’s smile grew wider.</p>
<p>Hellhound rolled her eyes. “I’ve already taken care of that
problem.”</p>
<p><em>She did not.</em></p>
<p>Blink shrugged. “Well, whatever then,” she turned to leave. She
reached into her pockets, then pulled out a few syringes filled with
thick red liquid. “Then I will just find a better place for these.”</p>
<p>Hellhound’s head snapped up.</p>
<p>PYRA.</p>
<p>Those few shots could keep her functioning a bit longer.<br />
<em>Don’t show desperation. Can’t announce weakness.</em></p>
<p>“Wait.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Blink stopped, then gracefully turned on her heels to face Hellhound
again, gun pressed flat against her lower back as she leaned forward
onto her toes.</p>
<p>“What do you want for those?” Hellhound rasped.</p>
<p>“Do you have sweets?”</p>
<p><em>The what now.</em></p>
<p>“I can just give some random drugs—”</p>
<p>Blink dropped one of the syringes. It hit the ground and rolled. She
stepped on it, glass snapping under her boot as the liquid bled into the
dirt.</p>
<p>“Hmm, I should really get my hands checked.”</p>
<p>Hellhound’s eye twitched but she quickly reached into her pocket. She
managed to fish out three half melted bonbons, and tossed them to Blink.
Blink caught them all without much effort, and looked awfully delighted
about her newly acquired treasure.</p>
<p>“Come.”</p>
<p>Hellhound groaned, but followed her.</p>
<p><em>I guess she will give me the drugs later.<br />
Or was she joking?<br />
Aghh, if I ask again, she might break another one.<br />
What is she even doing, escorting me?</em></p>
<p>They were heading towards the guest quarters, towards Hellhound’s
room. The silence around them felt wrong. This was far from what
Hellhound predicted.<br />
She thought the moment she set foot in the darkness, she would get
attacked. Even with Blink escorting her, the situation didn’t feel much
safer. But somehow it worked.</p>
<p><em>Maybe Skull wouldn’t attack her with company?<br />
Makes sense, after all, Nyx’s guards held him at gunpoint too.<br />
He hunted only when he could avoid leaving a trace.<br />
Which raised another question.</em></p>
<p>“Why are you even escorting me?”</p>
<p>“Because you’re funny. Now you can be funny for longer.”</p>
<p>Hellhound blinked. Twice. Her eye twitched again.</p>
<p>“Excuse me?”</p>
<p>“What.”</p>
<p>At the gates Blink shoved the remaining syringes into Hellhound's
chest. Hellhound barely managed to catch them with her one intact arm,
fumbling.</p>
<p>“How did you—”</p>
<p>“Hmm, now you DO have time for this, Hellhound?" Blink's grin
widened. "Let's just say I was bored.”</p>
<p>“Bored.”</p>
<p>“Very.” Blink yawned, stretched. "Night shift is a real drag.”</p>
<p>She turned, waved without looking back. "Don't die. I don’t like
losing my sweets supply."</p>
<p>She was already gone.</p>
<p>Hellhound exhaled through her nose. She glanced down at the syringes
and frowned. Then turned and entered the guest quarters.</p>
